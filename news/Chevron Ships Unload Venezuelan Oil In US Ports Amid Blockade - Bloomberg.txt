At least two vessels chartered by Chevron Corp. that picked up oil from Venezuela since the Trump administration launched a partial maritime blockade have successfully unloaded cargoes at US ports, according to data reviewed by Bloomberg.

Chevron, which holds a US license to drill and export oil from the sanctioned country, has finished discharging a cargo from the vessel Searuby and is in the process of unloading ship Canopus Voyager, according to Bloomberg tanker tracking. A ship called Nave Neutrino also off-loaded Venezuelan crude in the US Gulf Coast over the past few days, data from maritime intelligence firm Kpler show, though its unclear whether it’s chartered by Chevron.

Another three Chevron ships are sailing toward the US and appear set to discharge over the next few days, the data show. The oil company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The White House has ordered commanders in the region to focus for the next two months on quarantining Venezuelan oil as it ratchets up pressure on President Nicolas Maduro and seeks to cut off the country’s major source of revenue. On Friday, President Donald Trump said the US struck a “big facility” last week, an apparent reference to an attack on an alleged drug-trafficking site, the New York Times reported.
