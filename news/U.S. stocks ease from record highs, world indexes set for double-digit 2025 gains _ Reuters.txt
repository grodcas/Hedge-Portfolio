NEW YORK, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks dipped on Monday and gold tumbled from record highs at the top of a holiday-shortened week.

The three major U.S. stock indexes were weighed down by a broad selloff which was slightly mitigated by strength in some defensive sectors which have underperformed for much of the year.

Treasury yields eased and the dollar inched above its lowest level in almost three months, reflecting shifting expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in the coming year year.

"In light volume trading, we’re seeing a reversal of what we saw over the last couple of days," says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Seattle. "The broader market is looking at the strength of last week and selling off as we head into year-end. "

Market participants were closely monitoring negotiations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, with Trump saying they were getting "a lot closer" to a deal that could end Russia's war on Ukraine. But hopes for a deal dimmed after Russia accused Ukraine of trying to attack President Vladimir Putin's residence, in a potential roadblock to further negotiations.

With just three sessions remaining, U.S. and global stocks were on course to end 2025 near record highs, having notched double-digit gains in a tumultuous year dominated by tariff wars, central bank policy and simmering geopolitical tensions.

"When we started the year, we saw tariffs get implemented and the question was ‘will the market survive?’ The answer was yes," Haworth added. "The global economy has managed to weather many of the storms and uncertainties this year because consumers were spending and business continued to invest."

"The more we can broaden out, that gives this rally more room to run," Haworth said. "We’ve had three years of strong gains there’s reason for us to expect a fourth."
