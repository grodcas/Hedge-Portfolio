Dec 29 (Reuters) - Britain's biggest household gas and electricity supplier Octopus Energy Group is close to selling a 10% to 20% stake in its software unit, Kraken Technologies, in a deal that would value the business at $9 billion to $10 billion, Sky News reported on Monday, citing sources.

Kraken supplies energy-software technology to major utilities and energy groups including EDF, National Grid U.S. (NG.L), opens new tab and Tokyo Gas (9531.T), opens new tab.

Octopus Energy declined to confirm the Sky News report.

D1 Capital Partners, Fidelity and a unit of Canada's Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan are among the investors expected to take part, Sky News said.

A Sky News report in July said the technology group could be valued at up to 10 billion pounds ($13.49 billion) if it were spun off.

Ontario Teachers' did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. D1 Capital Partners could not be reached.
