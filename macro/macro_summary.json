      "date": "2025-10-29",
      "summary": "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announced a 25 basis point reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to 3.75–4.00 percent, signaling a pause in the rate cut cycle as the Committee decided to end reductions in aggregate securities holdings by December 1. This adjustment reflects the FOMC’s assessment that economic activity continues to expand at a moderate pace, though job gains have slowed and unemployment has slightly risen but remains low. Inflation has increased since early in the year and remains somewhat elevated, maintaining pressure on the Committee’s dual mandate of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.\n\nForward guidance emphasized the Committee’s attentiveness to elevated uncertainty and balanced risks in the economic outlook, noting a recent rise in downside risks to employment. The FOMC remains committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent target, and indicated readiness to adjust monetary policy as necessary based on incoming data across labor markets, inflation dynamics, financial conditions, and global developments. The Committee’s communication stressed careful monitoring of the evolving outlook before further policy moves.\n\nThe policy decision was not unanimous. Ten members, including Chair Powell and Vice Chair Williams, supported the 25 basis point cut. Two dissents were recorded: Stephen I. Miran preferred a more aggressive 50 basis point reduction, while Jeffrey R. Schmid advocated for no change in the target rate at this meeting. This vote split underscores differing views on the appropriate pace and scale of policy easing amidst ongoing economic uncertainty."
