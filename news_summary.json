      "summary": "Amazon Web Services (AWS) has expanded its partnership with Franco-Italian semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics NV to secure chips for its data centers. STMicro will provide AWS with semiconductors supporting high-bandwidth connectivity and energy-efficient power management essential for hyperscale data center operations. As part of the agreement, AWS received warrants to acquire up to 24.8 million ordinary shares of STMicro, exercisable over seven years at an initial price of $28.38 per share, dependent on payments for STMicro products. This marks AWS’s second investment in a chipmaker. Following the announcement, STMicro shares rose 6.5% to $26.51 at market open.\n\nThe global expansion of data centers driven by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies is boosting demand for semiconductor companies. Leading AI chip developers include Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Additionally, mature analog chip producers have increased sales for AI data center applications such as power management, sensors, and cooling. German semiconductor company Infineon Technologies projects AI-related revenues to reach €2.5 billion ($3 billion) by fiscal 2027, marking a tenfold increase within three years.\n\nSTMicro, a supplier to companies like Tesla and Apple, recently reported first-quarter revenue exceeding analyst expectations, citing some recovery in consumer electronics demand after a slump. Nonetheless, the company’s shares declined following the report due to uneven recovery across sectors. CEO Jean-Marc Chery stated that the automotive market remains unstable."

      "summary": "Goldman Sachs strategists, led by Ben Snider, forecast a significant rebound in US initial public offerings (IPOs) for 2026, with proceeds expected to reach $160 billion—more than triple the approximately $48 billion raised last year, excluding SPACs. They attribute this increase to factors such as solid economic conditions, rising CEO confidence, supportive monetary policy, and continued equity market gains. The number of deals is projected to nearly double to 120 listings, although total issuance would remain modest relative to market capitalization, at 0.2% of the Russell 3000, compared to 0.3% at the 2021 peak.\n\nThe year began unevenly, with some companies experiencing volatile trading debuts; for example, Veradermics Inc. surged 122% on its first day, while Eikon Therapeutics Inc. dropped 17%. Key risks identified include potential renewed market volatility, especially given the heavy presence of software companies in the IPO pipeline and recent declines in tech stocks due to concerns over returns from AI investments.\n\nLarge private firms planning public offerings add uncertainty to total issuance estimates, which could range from $80 billion if major companies remain private, to $200 billion if all proceed. Historical trends indicate that while elevated IPO activity often coincides with strong immediate S&P 500 returns, subsequent returns tend to be below average. However, recent IPOs feature lower valuations and higher profitability compared to past periods of intense IPO activity, which were marked by broad market exuberance."

      "summary": "Alphabet Inc. is raising funds extensively to support its large capital expenditure plans focused on artificial intelligence (AI). On Monday, the Google parent is issuing $15 billion in US corporate bonds and offering its first-ever bonds in Switzerland and the UK, including a rare 100-year bond—marking the first tech sector attempt at such a maturity since the late 1990s dotcom era.\n\nAlphabet announced plans to spend up to $185 billion in 2024 on capital expenditures, exceeding its combined spending of the past three years. These funds are primarily directed toward data centers essential for AI development, with early investments already driving revenue growth through increased online search activity.\n\nOther major technology companies such as Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are also significantly increasing their capital expenditures, which are collectively projected to reach approximately $650 billion by 2026. This surge in spending is fueling a wave of bond issuance in the market. For instance, Oracle recently raised $25 billion with record investor demand.\n\nAlphabet’s US dollar bond issuance has attracted over $100 billion in orders, consisting of up to seven tranches. The longest tranche matures in 2066, yielding roughly 0.95 percentage points above comparable Treasuries, slightly below earlier estimates. The bond sale is managed by major banks including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, and Wells Fargo.\n\nMorgan Stanley forecasts that hyperscale cloud providers will borrow around $400 billion in 2024, up from $165 billion in 2023, potentially driving record high-grade debt issuance of $2.25 trillion for the year. Analysts note the large bond supply may lead to wider credit spreads but do not anticipate an end-of-cycle credit downturn.\n\nAlphabet last issued US bonds in November 2023, raising $17.5 billion in a transaction with $90 billion of orders. That deal included a 50-year note, the longest tech bond in US dollars for that year, which has since tightened in secondary markets. The company also raised €6.5 billion in Europe at that time.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence estimates that capital spending on AI, cloud infrastructure, and data centers by major tech firms could reach $3 trillion by 2029."

      "summary": "The European Commission has issued a formal warning to Meta Platforms Inc. over policies that prevent rival artificial intelligence (AI) assistants from operating on WhatsApp. The Commission expressed concerns that Meta’s restrictions could harm market competition by blocking other AI tools from entering or expanding in the AI assistant sector. Under EU competition rules, regulators can impose temporary measures to halt such practices, which companies may contest in court. Potential fines for violations can reach up to 10% of a company’s global revenue, though this is uncommon if the infringement is short-term.\n\nThis regulatory action adds to growing tensions between US tech firms and Brussels, as Silicon Valley companies increasingly face pressures to change business models or face penalties. The Trump administration has criticized EU regulations, labeling them as unfair taxes or free speech infringements, potentially impacting broader trade negotiations and security discussions between the US and EU.\n\nEU Competition Chief Teresa Ribera emphasized that the enforcement aims to support market function and consumer protection, not political objectives. Meta has the opportunity to respond before any interim measures, which may include mandates to permit rival AI access on WhatsApp. A Meta spokesperson disputed the Commission’s position, stating users have various AI options outside WhatsApp Business API and questioning the EU’s key channel assumption.\n\nSeparately, WhatsApp’s information feeds recently became subject to the EU’s Digital Services Act, being classified as a “Very Large Online Platform,” thereby falling under stricter content moderation rules."

      "summary": "Microsoft shares were downgraded for a second time within a week amid concerns over the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on software stocks. Melius Research lowered Microsoft’s rating from buy to hold, citing worries about capital expenditure (capex) and the performance of Microsoft’s AI-related Copilot products, which integrate AI tools into its Office 365 suite. This followed a similar downgrade from Stifel, which highlighted slowing growth in Microsoft’s Azure cloud business.\n\nMelius analyst Ben Reitzes noted that competitors like Anthropic’s Cowork AI could pressure Microsoft to offer Copilot for free to remain competitive, which could hurt growth and margins in its profitable Productivity segment. Additionally, increased internal demand for Azure capacity to support AI tools may constrain its performance.\n\nThese downgrades come amid broader investor nervousness about software sector growth due to AI-driven disruption. A Goldman Sachs software stock index has fallen over 14% since late January. Despite this, Microsoft shares rose up to 2.4% on Monday but remain down over 24% from an October high.\n\nThe selloff followed Microsoft’s recent earnings report, which raised concerns about Azure’s growth slowing and heavy spending on AI development. Reitzes described Microsoft’s situation as challenging: it must increase capex significantly to compete with rivals Amazon and Alphabet, potentially reducing free cash flow. Failure to invest adequately might signal execution problems or earnings management.\n\nMelius also expressed skepticism about the financial payoff of AI, suggesting the market may not support premium pricing for AI features, implying Copilot might need to be bundled for free, increasing costs. Reflecting these concerns, Melius lowered its price target for Microsoft to $430.\n\nDespite these downgrades, approximately 96% of analysts tracked by Bloomberg still recommend buying Microsoft shares, with no sell ratings. The average price target remains just above $600, indicating potential upside of nearly 50% from current prices."

For the first time, executives including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and YouTube CEO Neal Mohan are expected to testify. The case centers on a 20-year-old woman from California claiming social media addiction caused her anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. Meta and Google deny wrongdoing, citing tools they’ve implemented to support teen safety, and arguing that harm derives from user-generated content, not product design.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the Social Media Victims Law Center, is viewed as a potential precedent for thousands of similar cases targeting TikTok, Snap, and others, alleging that algorithms and features like infinite scrolling prioritize engagement at the expense of young users’ well-being. Previous legal challenges mainly focused on harmful content but were shielded by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects platforms from liability for third-party posts. Plaintiffs argue, instead, the platforms’ own design causes harm.\n\nMeta plans to present studies disputing links between social media and teen mental health issues, emphasizing social benefits of connectivity. The trial follows related legal actions, including a New Mexico trial against Meta focused on child safety, state attorneys general suits, and public nuisance cases by school districts nationwide. Outcomes of these trials could lead to major settlements amounting to billions of dollars and prompt changes in how minors engage with social media platforms."

Stock indexes, after recent record highs and a pullback in tech stocks, rallied again as February began, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 50,000 for the first time—a psychological milestone. Concerns related to artificial intelligence negatively impacted semiconductor and software stocks in early February, according to strategist Ed Yardeni.\n\nPrecious metals funds experienced significant declines at January's end, although gold-focused funds still gained 11% for the month and 148% over the past 52 weeks. International-stock funds continued to outperform their historical trend by gaining 4.9% in January, following a 29.6% rise for all of 2025. Bond funds posted smaller gains, with investment-grade debt funds increasing 0.3% in January after a 7.2% advance in 2025. Notably, Kevin Warsh secured President Trump’s nomination to lead the Federal Reserve during this period.\n\nThe article also provides a historical overview: 55 years ago, Nasdaq was founded as a computer-based stock market without a trading floor, initially seen as risky compared to established exchanges like NYSE. Over time, Nasdaq became synonymous with innovation, housing leading tech and biotech firms such as Nvidia and Alphabet. It introduced small-order execution in the 1980s, enabling individual investors to trade smaller share quantities—a precursor to modern trading platforms. The Nasdaq is expected to move towards 24/7 trading in the future.\n\nOther historical references note that 40 years ago, small investors shifted from stock picking to mutual funds, believing they couldn't compete with institutions, and 75 years ago, tensions between the Federal Reserve and Treasury were expanding to Congress."

      "summary": "The article traces the evolution of the videogame industry from its origins to its status as a multibillion-dollar global market. Early electronic games began in the 1950s, notably with “Tennis for Two” in 1958. The first widely distributed modern videogame, “Spacewar,” was developed in 1961 by Steve Russell at MIT, running on a large, expensive computer. \n\nThe mass market introduction of videogames came in 1972 with Ralph Baer’s Magnavox Odyssey, the first home console, and Atari’s “Pong,” which launched the commercial videogame industry. Nintendo’s 1980s Nintendo Entertainment System shifted gameplay from direct competition to goal-oriented single-player adventures with titles like “Super Mario Bros.” By the late 1980s, Nintendo dominated the U.S. market until Sega introduced its 16-bit Genesis console in 1989, leading to a fierce rivalry until Sony’s PlayStation eventually supplanted Sega in the 1990s.\n\nThe rise of personal computers in the 1990s facilitated online multiplayer gaming, with Blizzard Entertainment pioneering connected gameplay through Battle.net in titles such as “StarCraft.” MMORPGs emerged with Origin Systems’ “Ultima Online” in 1997, allowing thousands of players to interact simultaneously in shared virtual worlds. Id Software’s “Doom” popularized first-person shooters and user-created modifications, laying groundwork for future game content platforms.\n\nTech giants Microsoft and Sony now lead console markets with Xbox and PlayStation, respectively, supporting large online communities. Gaming revenues have soared, with “Grand Theft Auto V” earning over $1 billion in three days, Microsoft’s acquisitions of Minecraft and Activision Blizzard totaling nearly $71 billion, and Roblox achieving a market value of about $38 billion. The videogame industry has grown from a niche hobby to one of the most profitable entertainment sectors worldwide."

The company is selling bonds in up to seven tranches, with initial pricing for the longest maturity (2066) at approximately 1.2 percentage points above U.S. Treasuries, per a regulatory filing that did not specify the total size. Technology companies are increasingly issuing substantial debt to finance infrastructure expansions amid growing demand for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Major cloud-computing firms, termed hyperscalers—including Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle—are projected to invest over $630 billion in AI this year. Despite high expenditures, returns on AI investments have not kept pace with the scale of outlays. In 2023, these five firms issued $121 billion in U.S. corporate bonds, far exceeding their average annual issuance of $28 billion from 2020 to 2022. For context, Oracle raised $18 billion in September, and Meta issued $30 billion in October—the largest non-M&A high-grade bond sale to date. Analysts forecast that, in addition to refinancing and merger-and-acquisition financing, bond issuance to support AI investments will be a principal driver of corporate debt offerings this year.

The field, which represents around 40% of Kazakhstan’s total oil output, produced about 550,000 barrels on February 8 and is expected to reach full output of about 950,000 barrels per day by February 23. Kazakhstan’s total oil and gas condensate production increased to 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week of February 1-8, up from 1.27 million bpd in January.\n\nThe recent decline in Tengiz production contributed to a fall in Kazakhstan’s oil exports, particularly through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) pipeline, which transports oil via Russia to the Black Sea. Industry sources indicated CPC exports may decrease to around 1.1 million bpd in February, down from a preliminary target of 1.7 million bpd. In January, CPC Blend oil loadings fell to 880,000 bpd, which was nearly half of the planned volume. Kazakhstan is investigating the January 18 power plant fires at Tengiz.

The case tests whether tech companies can be held liable for user harm linked to platform design, particularly affecting children. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify, and the trial may last into March. TikTok and Snap settled with K.G.M. prior to trial. The plaintiff’s lawyers argue the companies neglected safety, failed to warn users, and that the platforms contributed significantly to her injuries. If successful, the plaintiff could receive damages including punitive awards. Meta and Google intend to defend themselves by citing other life factors, their youth safety measures, and user-generated harmful content, invoking legal protections that generally shield internet companies from liability for user posts. A verdict rejecting this defense may facilitate similar lawsuits, of which thousands already exist in California. In federal court, over 2,300 related lawsuits by parents, school districts, and state attorneys general are pending, with trials possibly starting in June. Additionally, a separate trial in New Mexico starts Monday against Meta, accusing the company of enabling child sexual exploitation on its platforms.

      "summary": "Shell faces a potential production shortfall of 350,000 to 800,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2035 due to declining output from maturing fields, according to the company and industry analysts. The oil major's proven reserves—measured by reserve life—are expected to sustain less than 8 years of production by 2025, down from 9 years in 2024, significantly shorter than peers Exxon and TotalEnergies, which have reserve lives exceeding 12 years. This reserve depletion heightens the need for acquisitions or major exploration successes to maintain or grow production levels.\n\nShell aims to increase hydrocarbon output by 1% annually through the decade while keeping crude volumes steady and focusing on growing its liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales by at least 5% per year. However, total reserves fell to 8.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), the lowest since at least 2013. CEO Wael Sawan highlighted a projected production gap of 350,000 boed by 2035 compared to target levels, stemming from declines in current assets. This follows strategic withdrawals from U.S. shale and Guyana, regions important for competitors like Exxon.\n\nShell has partially addressed a near-term production gap of 100,000–200,000 boed through investments in fields across the U.S. Gulf, Brazil, Africa, and others, but no updated estimates for gaps beyond 2030 have been provided. Analysts express skepticism that incremental projects alone can meet Shell’s goals, suggesting a need for mergers, acquisitions, or significant new discoveries. Wood Mackenzie projects Shell’s output will decline sharply after 2028, with free cash flow in its gas and upstream segments weakening from 2032. UBS forecasts production falling to 2.5 million boed by 2035 without further investments, implying a production deficit of about 400,000 boed to be filled through asset deals or enhanced recovery efforts."

      "summary": "The software and services sector has experienced a significant recent decline, raising concerns about the impact of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom on market dynamics and traditional technology business models. After months of strong investor enthusiasm driven by AI developments, software stocks worldwide fell sharply amid fears that advanced AI tools could disrupt established earnings patterns. Although broader markets rebounded on Friday, the outlook for U.S. software shares remains uncertain, with options markets signaling continued volatility.\n\nThe selloff, which impacted markets from Europe to Asia, was sparked by the introduction of a new legal tool from Anthropic’s Claude language model, challenging conventional software industry assumptions. This has led investors to question the sustainability of the sector's growth, fueling a rotation into value and cyclical sectors such as energy, industrials, and consumer staples. Over the past three months, software and services stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 24 percentage points, a disparity near historic lows rivaling those seen during the 2000-2001 dot-com crash.\n\nSeveral major software firms have recorded steep losses since the sector’s peak in late October: Oracle declined nearly 50%, while ServiceNow and AppLovin each dropped over 40%. Other affected companies include Gartner, Palantir, Intuit, Datadog, and Workday. The technology sector overall has fallen about 10% since late October, in contrast to gains in sectors like energy and materials, contributing to stagnation in the S&P 500 despite gains across most sectors.\n\nOn February 9, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpassed 50,000 points, aided by Nvidia’s rally. Despite some recovery in the software sector, options market volatility remains high, with 30-day implied volatility for the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF near ten-month highs. Short interest in this ETF is also elevated at 19%, close to record levels, indicating significant bearish bets and uncertainty about the near-term direction of software stocks."
