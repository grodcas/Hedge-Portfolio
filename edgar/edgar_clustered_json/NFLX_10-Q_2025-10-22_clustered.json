Effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we discontinued reporting streaming membership metrics, including paid net membership additions (losses), paid memberships at end of period, average paying memberships and average monthly revenue per paying membership.\nTEXT: (2) See the “Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information” section below for additional details on our use of constant currency revenue.\nTEXT: Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2025 decreased by approximately one percentage point as compared to the prior comparative period. The decrease in operating margin was primarily driven by the growth in cost of revenues and sales and marketing expenses outpacing the growth in revenues, partially offset by a slower rate of growth in technology and development expenses and general and administrative expenses relative to revenue growth.\nTEXT: Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2025 increased $183 million as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to a $339 million increase in operating income, driven by a $1,686 million increase in revenues and partially offset by a $1,044 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to the increase in other cost of revenues and content amortization. The impact of higher operating income was partially offset by a $223 million increase in the provision for income taxes.\nTITLE: Revenues\nTEXT: We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of September 30, 2025, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $35 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $9 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\nTEXT: We also earn revenues from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live experiences and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and September 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Three months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: Three Months EndedChange September 30,2025September 30,2024Q3'25 vs. Q3'24 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenues$11,510,307 $9,824,703 $1,685,604 17 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months Ended Change; September 30,2025 September 30,2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24; Revenues $ 11,510,307 $ 9,824,703 $ 1,685,604 17 %.\nTITLE: Three Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: September 30,2025September 30,2024Q3'25 vs. Q3'24\nTITLE: September 30,2025\nTITLE: September 30,2024\nTITLE: Q3'25 vs. Q3'24\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: Nine Months EndedChange September 30,2025September 30,2024YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenues$33,132,274 $28,754,453 $4,377,821 15 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Nine Months Ended Change; September 30,2025 September 30,2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24; Revenues $ 33,132,274 $ 28,754,453 $ 4,377,821 15 %.\nTITLE: Nine Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: September 30,2025September 30,2024YTD'25 vs. YTD'24\nTITLE: September 30,2025\nTITLE: September 30,2024\nTITLE: YTD'25 vs. YTD'24\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 increased 17% and 15% as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the growth in memberships, price increases, and increased advertising revenue.

However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTEXT: In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on revenue, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency percentage change in revenues is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency revenue and the prior comparative period revenue. The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods.\nTEXT: The tables below summarize constant currency revenues by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and the constant currency percentage change in revenues by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:\nTEXT: Three Months EndedThree Months EndedChangeSeptember 30,2025September 30,2024Q3'25 vs. Q3'24As ReportedConstant Currency AdjustmentHedging (Gains) Losses Included in RevenuesConstant Currency RevenuesAs ReportedHedging (Gains) Losses Included in RevenuesRevenues Less Hedging ImpactReported ChangeConstant Currency Change(in thousands, except percentages)UCAN$5,071,781 $1,816 $(2,196)$5,071,401 $4,322,476 $(3,265)$4,319,211 17 %17 %EMEA3,699,052 (199,597)113,580 3,613,035 3,133,466 (1,857)3,131,609 18 %15 %LATAM1,370,913 53,678 26,300 1,450,891 1,240,892 (34,654)1,206,238 10 %20 %APAC1,368,561 (14,750)(8,319)1,345,492 1,127,869 (8,408)1,119,461 21 %20 %Total Revenues$11,510,307 $(158,853)$129,365 $11,480,819 $9,824,703 $(48,184)$9,776,519 17 %17 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Change; September 30,2025 September 30,2024 Q3'25 vs. Q3'24; As Reported Constant Currency Adjustment Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Constant Currency Revenues As Reported Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues Revenues Less Hedging Impact Reported Change Constant Currency Change; UCAN $ 5,071,781 $ 1,816 $ (2,196) $ 5,071,401 $ 4,322,476 $ (3,265) $ 4,319,211 17 % 17 %; EMEA 3,699,052 (199,597) 113,580 3,613,035 3,133,466 (1,857) 3,131,609 18 % 15 %; LATAM 1,370,913 53,678 26,300 1,450,891 1,240,892 (34,654) 1,206,238 10 % 20 %; APAC 1,368,561 (14,750) (8,319) 1,345,492 1,127,869 (8,408) 1,119,461 21 % 20 %; Total Revenues $ 11,510,307 $ (158,853) $ 129,365 $ 11,480,819 $ 9,824,703 $ (48,184) $ 9,776,519 17 % 17 %.\nTITLE: Three Months EndedThree Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: September 30,2025September 30,2024Q3'25 vs. Q3'24\nTITLE: September 30,2025\nTITLE: September 30,2024\nTITLE: Q3'25 vs. Q3'24\nTITLE: As Reported\nTITLE: Constant Currency Adjustment\nTITLE: Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues\nTITLE: Constant Currency Revenues\nTITLE: As Reported\nTITLE: Hedging (Gains) Losses Included in Revenues\nTITLE: Revenues Less Hedging Impact\nTITLE: Reported Change\nTITLE: Constant Currency Change\n"

The amount of principal and interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is $690 million. As of September 30, 2025, no amounts had been borrowed under the $3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement or the $3 billion Commercial Paper Program. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: We anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nTEXT: In September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 6,765,397 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $7.0 billion (excluding the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of September 30, 2025, $10.1 billion remains available for repurchases.\nTEXT: Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery, and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. Our other uses of cash include strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of September 30, 2025, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:\nTEXT: Payments due by PeriodContractual obligations (in thousands):TotalNext 12 MonthsBeyond 12 MonthsContent obligations (1)$20,940,900 $11,267,688 $9,673,212 Debt (2)18,394,940 690,341 17,704,599 Operating lease obligations (3)3,031,727 574,669 2,457,058 Total$42,367,567 $12,532,698 $29,834,869\nTABLE: TABLE: Contractual obligations (in thousands): Total Next 12 Months Beyond 12 Months; Content obligations (1) $ 20,940,900 $ 11,267,688 $ 9,673,212; Debt (2) 18,394,940 690,341 17,704,599; Operating lease obligations (3) 3,031,727 574,669 2,457,058; Total $ 42,367,567 $ 12,532,698 $ 29,834,869.\nTITLE: Payments due by Period\nTITLE: Contractual obligations (in thousands):TotalNext 12 MonthsBeyond 12 Months\nTITLE: Contractual obligations (in thousands):\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Next 12 Months\n"

However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.

Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2025, we had $14.5 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in twelve tranches due between 2026 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\nTEXT: We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 32% of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Canadian dollar, and the Argentine peso.\nTEXT: Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates and, in particular, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our revenues, on a constant currency basis, would have been approximately $349 million higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 than our reported revenues of $33,132 million. See Part I, Item 2, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $2,198 million and $1,850 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $210 million and $187 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n"
