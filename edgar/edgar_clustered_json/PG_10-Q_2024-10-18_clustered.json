The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $83 and $87, respectively.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.\nTEXT: As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was impaired during the year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion, which was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to further impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.\nTEXT: The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\nTEXT: Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\nTEXT: The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\nTEXT: The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nTEXT: Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bps Growth Rates-50 bps Royalty RateGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(5)%(5)%(4)%\n"

Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended September 30, 2024 or during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Cash equivalents were $10.7 billion and $8.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.\nTEXT: The fair value of long-term debt was $29.0 billion and $27.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3.9 billion and $3.8 billion as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.\nTITLE: Disclosures about Financial Instruments\nTEXT: The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, are as follows:\nTEXT: Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)September 30, 2024June 30, 2024September 30, 2024June 30, 2024September 30, 2024June 30, 2024DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$3,127 $2,993 $— $— $(249)$(325)DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency interest rate contracts$12,531 $10,140 $— $119 $(310)$(31)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,658 $13,133 $— $119 $(559)$(356)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$3,900 $3,192 $36 $1 $(3)$(23)TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$19,558 $16,325 $36 $120 $(562)$(379)\nTABLE: TABLE: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability); September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024; Interest rate contracts $ 3,127 $ 2,993 $ — $ — $ (249) $ (325); Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 12,531 $ 10,140 $ — $ 119 $ (310) $ (31); TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,658 $ 13,133 $ — $ 119 $ (559) $ (356); Foreign currency contracts $ 3,900 $ 3,192 $ 36 $ 1 $ (3) $ (23); TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 19,558 $ 16,325 $ 36 $ 120 $ (562) $ (379).\nTITLE: Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)\nTITLE: Notional Amount\nTITLE: Fair Value Asset\nTITLE: Fair Value (Liability)\nTITLE: September 30, 2024June 30, 2024September 30, 2024June 30, 2024September 30, 2024June 30, 2024\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\nTITLE: June 30, 2024\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\nTITLE: June 30, 2024\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\nTITLE: June 30, 2024\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nTITLE: Interest rate contracts$3,127 $2,993 $— $— $(249)$(325)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,127\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (249)\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nTITLE: Foreign currency interest rate contracts$12,531 $10,140 $— $119 $(310)$(31)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 12,531\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (310)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,658 $13,133 $— $119 $(559)$(356)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 15,658\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (559)\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nTITLE: Foreign currency contracts$3,900 $3,192 $36 $1 $(3)$(23)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,900\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 36\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (3)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$19,558 $16,325 $36 $120 $(562)$(379)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 19,558\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 36\nTITLE: $\n"

We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward.

Supplier Finance Programs\nTEXT: The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.7 billion as of September 30, 2024 and $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: 11. Restructuring Program\nTEXT: The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.\nTEXT: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded approximately $0.8 billion after tax of incremental charges, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.2 billion after tax.\nTEXT: For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred total before tax charges of $886 including $41 in Costs of products sold, $54 in SG&A and $791 in Other non-operating income/(expense).\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 12 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: The following table presents restructuring activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024:\nTEXT: Separation CostsAsset-Related CostsOther CostsTotalRESERVE JUNE 30, 2024$133 $— $32 $166 Costs incurred for the three months ended September 30, 202416 30 839 886 Costs paid/settled for the three months ended September 30, 2024(33)(30)(815)(879)RESERVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2024$116 $— $56 $172\nTABLE: TABLE: Separation Costs Asset-Related Costs Other Costs Total; RESERVE JUNE 30, 2024 $ 133 $ — $ 32 $ 166; Costs incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2024 16 30 839 886; Costs paid/settled for the three months ended September 30, 2024 (33) (30) (815) (879); RESERVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 $ 116 $ — $ 56 $ 172.\nTITLE: Separation CostsAsset-Related CostsOther CostsTotal\nTITLE: Separation Costs\nTITLE: Asset-Related Costs\nTITLE: Other Costs\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: RESERVE JUNE 30, 2024$133 $— $32 $166\nTITLE: RESERVE JUNE 30, 2024\nTITLE: RESERVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2024$116 $— $56 $172\nTITLE: RESERVE SEPTEMBER 30, 2024\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 116\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 56\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 172\nTITLE: Separation Costs\nTEXT: Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods.\nTITLE: Asset-Related Costs\nTEXT: Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing consolidations.

Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.\nTITLE: Other Costs\nTEXT: Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.\nTEXT: The MD&A is organized in the following sections:\nTEXT: •Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\nTEXT: •Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: •Segment Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: •Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTEXT: •Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP\nTEXT: Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTEXT: Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter to date market share through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n"

During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded incremental restructuring charges of approximately $0.8 billion after tax, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).

Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing\nTEXT: 16 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\nTEXT: For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2024\nTEXT: The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2024, versus the three months ended September 30, 2023.\nTEXT: Three Months Ended September 30Amounts in millions, except per share amounts20242023% ChgNet sales$21,737$21,871(1)%Operating income5,7975,7671%Earnings before income taxes5,1405,802(11)%Net earnings3,9874,556(12)%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble3,9594,521(12)%Diluted net earnings per common share1.611.83(12)%Core net earnings per common share1.931.835%Three Months Ended September 30COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES20242023Basis Pt ChgGross margin52.1 %52.0 %10 Selling, general & administrative expense25.4 %25.6 %(20)Operating income26.7 %26.4 %30 Earnings before income taxes23.6 %26.5 %(290)Net earnings18.3 %20.8 %(250)Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble18.2 %20.7 %(250)\nTABLE: TABLE: Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2024 2023 % Chg; Net sales $ 21,737 $ 21,871 (1)%; Operating income 5,797 5,767 1%; Earnings before income taxes 5,140 5,802 (11)%; Net earnings 3,987 4,556 (12)%; Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,959 4,521 (12)%; Diluted net earnings per common share 1.61 1.83 (12)%; Core net earnings per common share 1.93 1.83 5%; COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2024 2023 Basis Pt Chg; Gross margin 52.1 % 52.0 % 10; Selling, general & administrative expense 25.4 % 25.6 % (20); Operating income 26.7 % 26.4 % 30; Earnings before income taxes 23.6 % 26.5 % (290); Net earnings 18.3 % 20.8 % (250); Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.2 % 20.7 % (250).\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 30\n"

The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted.\nTEXT: Organic sales growth.
