The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations actually would have been had the merger been completed on January 1, 2023. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results reflect pro forma adjustments primarily related to conforming Pioneer's accounting policies to ExxonMobil, additional depreciation expense related to the fair value adjustment of the acquired property, plant and equipment, our capital structure, Pioneer's transaction-related costs, and applicable income tax impacts of the pro forma adjustments.\nTEXT: Our transaction costs to effect the acquisition were immaterial.\nTITLE: Litigation\nTEXT: A variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed.\nTEXT: State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.\nTEXT: Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.\nTEXT: While the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.\n"

In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue\" and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in “Cash Flows from Operating Activities”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting.

This program utilizes fair value hedge accounting.

Changes in the fair values of the hedging instruments are perfectly offset by changes in the fair values of the hedged items; the effects of these changes in fair values are recorded in \"Interest expense\" in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This program was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements as of the end of third quarter 2025.\nTEXT: Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties.

Natural gas prices remained at the top of the 10-year range on robust global demand. Global industry refining margins moved toward the top of the 10-year historical range in the third quarter, impacted by industry supply outages coupled with strong demand. Chemical margins remained at bottom of cycle, well below the 10-year range, with continued industry oversupply.\nTEXT: During 2025, the U.S. announced a variety of trade-related actions, including the imposition of tariffs on imports from several countries. In response, many countries announced their own retaliatory tariffs. Despite the current uncertainty as to what effects these actions will ultimately have on the Corporation, our suppliers and our customers, as well as on the overall macroeconomic environment, we do not anticipate any material near-term financial impacts.\nTITLE: Selected Earnings Driver Definitions\nTEXT: The earnings drivers provide additional visibility into our business results. The Corporation evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\nTEXT: •Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects). Includes Permian, Guyana, and LNG.\nTEXT: •Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\nTEXT: •High-Value Products. Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nTEXT: Base Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\nTEXT: Structural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on page 23, including cash operating expenses related to divestments.\nTEXT: Expenses. Represents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\nTEXT: Timing Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n"

The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results.

Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $14.3 billion, which included an additional $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2025. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Structural Cost Savings from new operations, mergers and acquisitions, and new business venture developments are included in the cumulative Structural Cost Savings. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.\nTEXT: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted)Twelve MonthsEnded December 31,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2019202420242025Components of Operating CostsFrom ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income(U.S. GAAP)Production and manufacturing expenses36.8 39.6 28.8 30.3 Selling, general and administrative expenses11.4 10.0 7.4 8.1 Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments)19.0 23.4 16.9 18.3 Exploration expenses, including dry holes1.3 0.8 0.6 0.5 Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense1.2 0.1 0.1 0.3 Subtotal69.7 74.0 53.7 57.4 ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP)9.1 9.6 7.1 7.8 Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3 Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3 Less:Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments)19.0 23.4 16.9 18.3 Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense1.2 0.1 0.1 0.3 Other adjustments (includes equity company depreciation and depletion)3.6 3.7 2.5 3.7 Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)55.0 56.4 41.3 43.0 Energy and production taxes (Non-GAAP)11.0 13.9 10.3 11.2 Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)44.0 42.5 31.0 31.8 Change vs 2019Change vs 2024Estimated Cumulative vs 2019Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)-1.5+0.8Market+4.0+0.5Activity / Other+6.6+2.5Structural Cost Savings-12.1-2.2-14.3Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\nTABLE: TABLE: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted) Twelve MonthsEnded December 31, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,; 2019 2024 2024 2025; Production and manufacturing expenses 36.8 39.6 28.8 30.3; Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.4 10.0 7.4 8.1; Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments) 19.0 23.4 16.9 18.3; Exploration expenses, including dry holes 1.3 0.8 0.6 0.5; Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense 1.2 0.1 0.1 0.3; Subtotal 69.7 74.0 53.7 57.4; ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP) 9.1 9.6 7.1 7.8; Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP) 78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3; Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP) 78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3; Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments) 19.0 23.4 16.9 18.3; Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense 1.2 0.1 0.1 0.3; Other adjustments (includes equity company depreciation and depletion) 3.6 3.7 2.5 3.7; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP) 55.0 56.4 41.3 43.0; Energy and production taxes (Non-GAAP) 11.0 13.9 10.3 11.2; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP) 44.0 42.5 31.0 31.8; Change vs 2019 Change vs 2024 Estimated Cumulative vs 2019; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP) -1.5 +0.8; Market +4.0 +0.5; Activity / Other +6.6 +2.5; Structural Cost Savings -12.1 -2.2 -14.3.\nTEXT: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted)\nTITLE: Components of Operating Costs\nTITLE: From ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income(U.S. GAAP)\nTITLE: Subtotal69.7 74.0 53.7 57.4\nTITLE: Subtotal\nTITLE: 69.7\nTITLE: 74.0\nTITLE: 53.7\nTITLE: 57.4\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 78.8\nTITLE: 83.6\nTITLE: 60.8\nTITLE: 65.3\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 60.8 65.3\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 78.8\nTITLE: 83.6\nTITLE: 60.8\nTITLE: 65.3\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)55.0 56.4 41.3 43.0\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 55.0\nTITLE: 56.4\nTITLE: 41.3\nTITLE: 43.0\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)44.0 42.5 31.0 31.8\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 44.0\nTITLE: 42.5\nTITLE: 31.0\nTITLE: 31.8\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)-1.5+0.8\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings-12.1-2.2-14.3\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings\nTITLE: -12.1\nTITLE: -2.2\nTITLE: -14.3\nTEXT: Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n"

These drivers include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such drivers can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\nTEXT: Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.\nTEXT: Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\nTEXT: Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational drivers not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such drivers include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.\nTITLE: ENERGY PRODUCTS\nTEXT: Energy Products Financial Results(millions of dollars)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2025202420252024Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)United States858 517 1,980 1,803 Non-U.S.982 792 2,053 1,828 Total1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631 Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)United States858 517 1,980 1,803 Non-U.S.982 792 2,053 1,828 Total1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631 (1) Refer to page 22 for definition of Identified Items and earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items.\nTABLE: TABLE: (millions of dollars) Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,; 2025 2024 2025 2024; United States 858 517 1,980 1,803; Non-U.S. 982 792 2,053 1,828; Total 1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631; United States 858 517 1,980 1,803; Non-U.S. 982 792 2,053 1,828; Total 1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631.\nTITLE: Energy Products Financial Results\nTITLE: (millions of dollars)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: Three Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: 2025202420252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\nTITLE: Total1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 1,840\nTITLE: 1,309\nTITLE: 4,033\nTITLE: 3,631\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: Total1,840 1,309 4,033 3,631\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 1,840\nTITLE: 1,309\nTITLE: 4,033\nTITLE: 3,631\nTEXT: (1) Refer to page 22 for definition of Identified Items and earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items.\nTITLE: Energy Products Third Quarter Earnings Driver Analysis (millions of dollars)\nTEXT: Margin – Increased earnings by $1,010 million from stronger industry refining margins driven by supply disruptions.\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth – Increased earnings by $40 million.\nTEXT: Base Volume – Increased earnings by $40 million.\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $130 million.\nTITLE: Expenses – Decreased earnings by $220 million driven by growth projects.\nTEXT: Other – Decreased earnings by $20 million.\nTEXT: Timing Effects – Decreased earnings by $450 million, mainly from the absence of prior year favorable derivatives mark-to-market impacts.\nTITLE: Energy Products Year-to-Date Earnings Driver Analysis (millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Margins – Decreased earnings by $90 million.\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth – Increased earnings by $50 million.\nTEXT: Base Volume – Increased earnings by $240 million, mainly driven by lower scheduled maintenance and stronger reliability.\n"

The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on ExxonMobil’s Global Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly.

Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Corporate planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders.
