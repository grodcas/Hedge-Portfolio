The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, was $79 and $83, respectively.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.\nTEXT: Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%. As of September 30, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger an impairment charge.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rate), discount rate and royalty rate.\nTEXT: Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rate represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\nTEXT: The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\nTEXT: The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\nTEXT: We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2024, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate.\nTEXT: Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bps Growth Rates-50 bps Royalty RateGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(5)%(5)%(4)%\nTABLE: TABLE: +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates -50 bps Royalty Rate; Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset (5) % (5) % (4) %.\nTITLE: Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value\nTITLE: +25 bps Discount Rate-25 bps Growth Rates-50 bps Royalty Rate\nTITLE: +25 bps Discount Rate\nTITLE: -25 bps Growth Rates\nTITLE: -50 bps Royalty Rate\n"

We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately $132, including interest and penalties.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 12 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n"

Supplier Finance Programs\nTEXT: The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.9 billion as of September 30, 2025 and $5.8 billion as of June 30, 2025.\nTITLE: 11. Restructuring Program\nTEXT: The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.\nTEXT: In June 2025, the Company announced a portfolio and productivity plan to streamline its portfolio and organization to improve its cost structure and competitiveness. The Company expects to incur approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over two years. The Company expects to incur half of the costs under this plan by the end of fiscal 2026, with the remainder incurred in fiscal 2027.\nTEXT: The restructuring activities will be executed across the Sector Business Units as well as the Enterprise Markets, Corporate Functions and Global Business Services. These restructuring activities include a plan for a reduction of up to 7,000 non-manufacturing overhead personnel by the end of fiscal 2027. In addition, the plan includes brand and market exits as well as the optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes.\nTEXT: Costs incurred under the plan will consist primarily of costs to separate employees and asset-related costs to exit facilities. The Company will also incur other types of costs outlined below as a direct result of the plan.

We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTEXT: Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market share through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In the presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n"

Net sales increased mid-single digits in Beauty and Grooming and low single digits in Health Care, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Fabric & Home Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased mid-single digits in Beauty and low single digits in Grooming and Health Care. Organic sales in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care were unchanged.\nTEXT: •Net earnings were $4.8 billion, an increase of $794 million, or 20%, versus the prior year period due primarily to higher restructuring charges related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina in the prior year period.\nTEXT: •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $4.8 billion, an increase of $791 million, or 20%, versus the prior year period.\nTEXT: •Diluted EPS increased 21% to $1.95 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes incremental restructuring charges, increased 3% to $1.99.\nTEXT: •Operating cash flow was $5.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the 2017 U.S. Tax Act, was $4.9 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, was 102%.\nTITLE: ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nTEXT: Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for 1% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 17\nTEXT: general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements, including tariffs, can also impact our financial performance.\nTEXT: For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n"
