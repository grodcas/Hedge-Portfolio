At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $1,000 and $1,002.\nTITLE: Product Warranties\nTEXT: The following table summarizes changes in product warranty liabilities recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.\nTEXT: 20252024Beginning balance – January 1$2,133 $2,448 Additions for current year deliveries82 42 Reductions for payments made(174)(227)Changes in estimates298 (8)Ending balance – June 30$2,339 $2,255\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Additions for current year deliveries — 2025: 82; 2024: 42\nTABLE_ROW: Reductions for payments made — 2025: (174); 2024: (227)\nTABLE_ROW: Changes in estimates — 2025: 298; 2024: (8)\nTITLE: 20252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: Beginning balance – January 1$2,133 $2,448\nTITLE: $2,133\nTITLE: Additions for current year deliveries82 42\nTITLE: 82\nTITLE: Reductions for payments made(174)(227)\nTITLE: (174)\nTITLE: Changes in estimates298 (8)\nTITLE: 298\nTITLE: Ending balance – June 30$2,339 $2,255\nTITLE: $2,339\nTITLE: Commercial Aircraft Trade-In Commitments\nTEXT: In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.\nTEXT: Trade-in commitment agreements at June 30, 2025, have expiration dates from 2025 through 2032. At June 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,403 and $1,393. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, we estimated it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $65 and $275 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $63 and $270.\nTITLE: Financing Commitments\nTEXT: Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $16,586 and $17,124 as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of June 30, 2025 are as follows:\nTEXT: TotalJuly through December 2025$1,820 20262,263 20273,215 20283,696 20292,081 Thereafter3,511 Total$16,586\nTABLE: TABLE: July through December 2025 $1,820; 2026 2,263; 2027 3,215; 2028 3,696; 2029 2,081; Thereafter 3,511; Total $16,586.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, $13,260 of these financing commitments relate to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.\nTITLE: Other Financial Commitments\nTEXT: We have financial commitments to make additional capital contributions totaling $269 to certain joint ventures over the next eight years.\nTITLE: Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nTEXT: We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts and security agreements. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $2,976 and $2,991 as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nTITLE: Supply Chain Financing Programs\nTEXT: The Company has supply chain financing programs in place under which participating suppliers may elect to obtain payment from an intermediary. The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on invoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within 30 to 90 days. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Accounts payable included $1,638 and $2,703 payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in these programs. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing would have a significant impact on our liquidity.\n"

We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government.\nTITLE: Fixed-Price Contracts\nTEXT: Long-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, services and related technologies. Estimating the cost and time for us and our suppliers to complete these contracts is inherently uncertain due to operational and technical complexities. This uncertainty requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future operational and technical performance, and the outcome of customer and/or supplier contractual negotiations. The risk that actual performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those previously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\nTITLE: VC-25B Presidential Aircraft\nTEXT: The Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the U.S. Air Force's (USAF) VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $4 billion program to develop and modify two 747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $379. We are continuing to work with the customer to reset the schedule as they adjust requirements. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: KC-46A Tanker\nTEXT: In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver four next-generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized 11 low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 154 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $29 billion as of June 30, 2025. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of the 767 commercial airplane program with the majority of the manufacturing costs being incurred in the 767 factory and the remaining costs being incurred in the military finishing and delivery centers. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $2,002. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately $93 of capitalized precontract costs and $245 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to Lots 12 and 13. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: MQ-25\nTEXT: In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of seven aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 in the third quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $657 for two additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $339. We expect the initial EMD units to complete production in 2025. During the first half of 2025, we initiated final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, and began ground-based flight testing. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options\nTEXT: In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract was a $860 fixed-price contract and included five aircraft and seven simulators. The five EMD aircraft were delivered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing. In January 2025, the USAF announced an updated acquisition approach for the T-7A Red Hawk that allows the Company to provide a production-ready configuration to the customer prior to low-rate initial production, which better supports the operational needs of the customer and reduces future production risk. In June 2025, the customer ordered four production representative test vehicles. The production portion of the contract now includes production lots for 342 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and related services that we believe are probable of being exercised. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770. At June 30, 2025, we had approximately $266 of capitalized precontract costs and $742 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: Commercial Crew\nTEXT: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $523. We are continuing to work toward crew certification and resolve the propulsion system anomalies. At June 30, 2025, we had approximately $404 of capitalized precontract costs and $144 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions.

Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.\nTEXT: Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.\nTEXT: Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities.

Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2029.\nTITLE: Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment\nTEXT: We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts and commodity swaps which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.\n"

We expect approximately 21% to be converted to revenue through 2026 and approximately 64% through 2029, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nTITLE: Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other\nTEXT: Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business operations and eliminations of certain sales between segments.

A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters.

Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constituted the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that was required to be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators returned their fleets to service in the first quarter of 2024. All 737-9 aircraft in production are undergoing this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.\nTEXT: As a result of the accident, the FAA performed an investigation into the 737 quality control system. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.\nTEXT: On November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon).

The increase in contractual backlog of $84,945 million during the six months ended June 30, 2025, was primarily due to an $87,022 million increase in BCA backlog. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nTEXT: Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase of $12,257 million in unobligated backlog during the six months ended June 30, 2025 was due to an increase in BDS backlog.\nTITLE: Additional Considerations\nTEXT: U.S. Government Funding Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future U.S. government budget and program decisions will unfold, including the spending priorities of the Administration and Congress.\nTEXT: The Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, enacted on March 15, 2025, largely continues federal funding at fiscal year 2024 appropriated levels through September 30, 2025. This bill has been deemed to be a full-year appropriations bill in respect to satisfying the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, avoiding a sequester of defense and non-defense spending in fiscal year 2025 (FY25).\nTEXT: Global Trade The global trade landscape is currently highly volatile. Various countries have announced plans for and/or have implemented new or modified tariffs.\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025, the United States imposed modified tariffs on aluminum and steel imports and additional tariffs on goods from China. In addition, the United States imposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico that are not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). We believe that the majority of our imports from Canada and Mexico are compliant with the provisions of the USMCA.\nTEXT: During the second quarter of 2025, the United States adjusted various tariff rates, including on aluminum and steel imports, and announced broad reciprocal tariffs on imports from all countries. In May 2025, the U.S. and China reduced the reciprocal tariffs on each other's imports until August 12, 2025, while trade negotiations continue. On May 8, 2025, the United States and the United Kingdom announced a bilateral trade agreement. That agreement became effective June 30, 2025, in the United States and recognizes tariff-free trade of products within the scope of the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, a 10% baseline reciprocal tariff was in place for all countries. In July 2025, the pause on previously announced reciprocal tariffs at rates higher than 10% for specific countries was extended until August 1, 2025, while bilateral trade negotiations take place with various United States trading partners. The United States has asserted that reciprocal tariff rates for many trade partners could increase from the 10% baseline tariff on August 1, 2025, unless agreements are reached.\nTEXT: Collectively, these tariffs and any retaliatory actions taken by countries in response to the United States tariffs could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. Our second quarter results reflect our best estimate of the impacts of the tariffs enacted as of June 30, 2025, and certain potential mitigating actions.\nTEXT: We seek to comply with all U.S. and other government import requirements, export control requirements and sanctions. We continually monitor the global trade environment for new and/or changing tariffs, retaliatory actions, trade agreements, export restrictions, sanctions or other restrictions that may impact us or our supply chain or customers, and work to mitigate impacts to our business.\nTEXT: The current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers. After pausing deliveries in April 2025, China resumed accepting deliveries in June 2025. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship is challenged due to tariffs, export restrictions and related supply chain constraints, and other economic and national security concerns.\nTEXT: Supply Chain We and our suppliers are experiencing inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. Our supply chain is also being impacted by the tariffs and export restrictions discussed above. Certain of our suppliers are also experiencing financial difficulties. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During 2024, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,770 million on the T-7A Red Hawk program that was primarily driven by projected increases in supplier cost estimates. In addition, we recorded losses on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs during 2024 that were partially attributable to higher supplier costs.\nTITLE: Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nTITLE: Commercial Airplanes\n"

Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\nTEXT: BCA total backlog increased from $435,175 million as of December 31, 2024, to $522,197 million at June 30, 2025, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries and a decrease in the value of existing orders that, in our assessment, do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the six months ended June 30, 2025, totaled $2,649 million and primarily relate to 737 aircraft. Net ASC 606 adjustments during the six months ended June 30, 2025, totaled $12,431 million and primarily relate to 777X aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\n"

As a result of the accident, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of Boeing’s production and quality and safety management systems. The FAA also communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. In 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified in connection with the FAA's investigation. We also took additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture. In 2025, we are continuing to implement these improvements and align our production plans consistent with the comprehensive safety and quality plan.\nTEXT: We increased the accounting quantity by 400 units during the six months ended June 30, 2025 due to the\nTEXT: program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We gradually increased the production rate to 38 per month during the first half of 2025 operating within our safety and quality plan. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 20 737-8 aircraft in inventory for customers in\nTEXT: China that were produced prior to 2023. We are scheduled to deliver these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear whether the trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact future deliveries to China.\nTEXT: We are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we continue to work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system. We now expect certification to occur in 2026. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nTEXT: If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 7 and Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 767 Program The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently targeting a production rate of approximately three aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 767 commercial program by 2027. This program has break-even gross margins.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program extends through year-end 2027. We increased the accounting quantity by three units during the six months ended June 30, 2025, because we now expect to produce an additional three units in that timeframe. We are currently targeting a combined production rate of four per month for the 777/777X programs.\nTEXT: In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. The first phase of flight testing was paused starting in August 2024 and resumed in January 2025. During the first six months of 2025, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin additional phases of certification flight testing.\nTEXT: We continue to anticipate first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter to occur in 2028. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nTEXT: The 777X program had break-even gross margins at June 30, 2025. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and any change in the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in reach-forward losses in future periods.\nTEXT: 787 Program During the second quarter of 2025, the program began increasing the production rate to seven per month. We are continuing to monitor supply chain health and factory performance as we work to increase production rates. As of June 30, 2025, we had approximately 15 aircraft in inventory, including three aircraft for customers in China, that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. In February 2025, we completed the rework of the last aircraft and expect to deliver the majority of these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear whether the trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact future deliveries to China.\nTITLE: Additional Considerations\nTEXT: On June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

The increase reflects the timing of awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\nTITLE: Additional Considerations\nTEXT: Our BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nTEXT: Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\nTITLE: Global Services\nTITLE: Results of Operations\nTEXT: (Dollars in millions)Six months ended June 30Three months ended June 302025202420252024Revenues$10,344 $9,934 $5,281 $4,889 Earnings from operations$1,992 $1,786 $1,049 $870 Operating margins19.3 %18.0 %19.9 %17.8 %\nTABLE: TABLE: (Dollars in millions) Six months ended June 30 Three months ended June 30; 2025 2024 2025 2024; Revenues $10,344 $9,934 $5,281 $4,889; Earnings from operations $1,992 $1,786 $1,049 $870; Operating margins 19.3 % 18.0 % 19.9 % 17.8 %.\nTITLE: (Dollars in millions)Six months ended June 30Three months ended June 30\nTITLE: Six months ended June 30\nTITLE: Three months ended June 30\nTITLE: 2025202420252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: Revenues$10,344 $9,934 $5,281 $4,889\nTITLE: $10,344\nTITLE: $5,281\nTITLE: Earnings from operations$1,992 $1,786 $1,049 $870\nTITLE: $1,992\nTITLE: $1,049\nTITLE: Operating margins19.3 %18.0 %19.9 %17.8 %\nTITLE: 19.3\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 19.9\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Revenues\nTEXT: BGS revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025 increased by $410 million compared with the same period in 2024, primarily due to higher government services revenue.

At June 30, 2025 we were in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit facility agreements.\nTEXT: For discussion related to the Spirit Acquisition and Digital Aviation Solutions Divestiture, see Note 2 and Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: We currently maintain investment grade credit ratings across all three credit rating agencies. In June 2025, Fitch affirmed the BBB- credit rating and revised the outlook to stable from negative. In April 2025, S&P affirmed the BBB- credit rating with a negative outlook and removed the credit watch negative. At Moody's we are rated Baa3 with a negative outlook.\nTEXT: We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements; however, a number of factors could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on terms acceptable to us, and negatively impact our access to the capital and financial markets and our ability to fund our operations and commitments. These factors include further downgrades in our credit ratings, disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliveries, and changes in demand for our products and services. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments. See “Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.\n"

For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Contingent Obligations\nTEXT: We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:\nTEXT: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 18 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $848 million at June 30, 2025. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Non-GAAP Measures\nTITLE: Core Operating Earnings/(Loss), Core Operating Margins and Core Earnings/(Loss) Per Share\nTEXT: Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement income. Non-operating pension and postretirement income represents the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nTEXT: The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Earnings/(loss) from operations were benefits of $390 million and $197 million for the six and three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with benefits of $460 million and $230 million for the same periods in 2024. The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $85 million and $42 million for the six and three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with $245 million and $122 million for the same periods in 2024. The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" on pages 28 and 29 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Management uses Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.\n"
