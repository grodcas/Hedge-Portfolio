Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to our receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at November 2, 2025 or February 2, 2025.\nTITLE: Supplier Finance Program\nTEXT: We have a supplier finance program whereby participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to receive payment for one or more of our payment obligations, prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from participating financial institutions. The payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program, and we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program, and we have not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program. Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program were $333 million at November 2, 2025 and $598 million at February 2, 2025 and are recorded within accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: On July 4, 2025, the legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) was signed into law in the U.S., which contains a broad range of tax provisions, including the allowance to expense 100% of the cost of qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures. While we continue to assess its implications, we do not expect the provisions of the OBBBA to have a material impact to our estimated fiscal 2025 effective tax rate. We have realized, and expect to continue to realize, a reduction in our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments due to the above mentioned provisions.\nTEXT: In fiscal 2024, the Internal Revenue Service provided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states, extending the timeline to make certain tax payments. As a result, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment was deferred and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nTEXT: We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the nine months ended November 2, 2025 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTITLE: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nTEXT: ASU No. 2025-06. In September 2025, the FASB issued ASU No. 2025-06, “Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software,” which is intended to modernize internal-use software guidance by removing all references to project stages and by clarifying the thresholds entities apply to begin capitalizing costs. ASU No. 2025-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, and interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance can be applied on a prospective basis, a modified basis for in-process projects, or a retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed above or in the 2024 Form 10-K are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTITLE: 2.SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\nTITLE: SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\n"

For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three geographic operating segments into one reportable segment (the “Primary segment”) due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.\nTEXT: Other. As discussed in Note 10, in June 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor through branches located throughout the U.S. On September 4, 2025, SRS completed the acquisition of GMS, a leading distributor of specialty building products, including drywall, ceilings, steel framing and other complementary construction products, through branches located across the U.S. and Canada. GMS became an additional vertical within SRS referred to as interior and construction products, and SRS is now organized as four different lines of business: roofing and building products, interior and construction products, landscape, and pool. We have determined that each of these four lines of business represents an operating segment, none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280: “Segment Reporting” to be deemed a reportable segment. Therefore, results from these operating segments are presented in “Other.”\nTEXT: Net sales presented in Other in the tables below relate to the sale of products within these non-reportable operating segments, including our recently acquired interior and construction products operating segment beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Roofing and related products accounted for approximately 50% and 57% of net sales in Other during the three and nine months ended November 2, 2025, respectively, and approximately 68% and 67% during the three and nine months ended October 27, 2024, respectively.\nTEXT: Segment Information.

Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and to minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of certain senior notes.\nTEXT: We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at both November 2, 2025 and February 2, 2025. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At November 2, 2025 and February 2, 2025, the fair values of these agreements totaled $565 million and $795 million, respectively, all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. At November 2, 2025 and February 2, 2025, the carrying amount of our long-term debt, excluding current installments, subject to fair value hedges was $14.6 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively.\nTEXT: During the three and nine months ended November 2, 2025, there was no new material hedging activity or material change to any other hedging arrangement disclosed in our 2024 Form 10-K, and all related activity was immaterial for the periods presented within this report.\nTEXT: Collateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $444 million and $668 million as of November 2, 2025 and February 2, 2025, respectively, which was recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nTEXT: •Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nTEXT: •Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nTEXT: •Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company’s own models with estimates and assumptions.\n"

Under the terms of the merger agreement, we, through a wholly owned subsidiary, made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of GMS common stock for $110 per share. All conditions of the offer were satisfied, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, and the merger was completed on September 4, 2025. As a result of the merger, GMS became a direct subsidiary of SRS and an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We believe the GMS acquisition will enhance SRS's position as a leading multi-category building materials distributor, bringing differentiated capabilities, product categories and customer relationships that are highly complementary to SRS's existing business.\nTEXT: Cash consideration remitted by the Company for the purchase of all outstanding shares of GMS common stock totaled approximately $4.3 billion, and we also repaid approximately $1.2 billion of certain GMS outstanding debt concurrent with the completion of the merger. The merger consideration and repayment of GMS debt was funded through a combination of cash on hand and approximately $2.0 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program, which were refinanced with the issuance of $2.0 billion of long-term debt in September 2025 (see Note 5).\nTEXT: The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805: “Business Combinations” and GMS’s results of operations have been consolidated in the Company’s financial statements effective September 4, 2025.

Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.62 per diluted share. For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, net sales were $126.5 billion and net earnings were $11.6 billion, or $11.65 per diluted share.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we opened three new stores in the U.S., resulting in a total store count of 2,356 at November 2, 2025. A total of 322 stores, or 13.7%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.5 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by higher average inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2025, we generated $13.0 billion of cash flow from operations, received $2.9 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments, and received $2.1 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund $6.9 billion in cash dividends, repay $3.4 billion of long-term debt, and fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures. We also completed the GMS acquisition, including the repayment of certain of its outstanding debt, for aggregate cash consideration totaling approximately $5.5 billion. In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.30 per share.\nTEXT: Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 26.3% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and 31.5% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity largely due to the financing of the SRS acquisition. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC.\nTITLE: GMS Acquisition\nTEXT: On June 29, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GMS, a leading distributor of specialty building products, including drywall, ceilings, steel framing and other complementary construction products, through branches located across the U.S. and Canada.

We have worked, and continue to work, diligently to diversify our global supply chain and to implement other cost mitigation initiatives. While we have experienced increased costs as a result of tariffs, our actions, including diversification efforts and modest price increases, along with our scale, vendor relationships, experienced internal teams, and other initiatives have allowed us to effectively mitigate the impact on our results of operations. We plan to continue to assess our sourcing and other mitigation strategies to maintain a strong value proposition for our customers and believe we remain well positioned to manage the impact that tariffs in effect as of the date of this filing are expected to have on our business.\nTEXT: As trade policy discussions and developments are ongoing, we cannot predict with certainty their ultimate impact on our business in future periods, including our results of operations and cash flows.

For purposes of the following discussion, comparable sales, comparable customer transactions, and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 13-week period from fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Net Sales. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were $41.4 billion, an increase of 2.8% from $40.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by sales from GMS, which was acquired on September 4, 2025 and contributed $892 million of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2025. Net sales also increased due to the impact of a positive comparable sales environment and sales from new stores and branches, partially offset by the calendar shift which resulted in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 including one less week of summer and one additional week of fall.\nTEXT: Online sales, which consist of sales of products generated through websites and mobile applications, represented 15.2% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased by 11.4% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Fiscal 2025 includes 52 weeks and fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks. For our calculation of comparable sales in fiscal 2025, we will compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2025 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2024. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTEXT: Total comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 0.2%, primarily reflecting a 1.8% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 1.6% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

SG&A for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $424 million, or 5.9%, to $7.6 billion from $7.2 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 18.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher payroll and related costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2025 within our Primary segment, along with transaction costs related to the GMS acquisition.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $31 million, or 3.9%, to $826 million from $795 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years.

These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.

In line with our expectation of approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2025 net sales, we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 across initiatives to improve the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities, to continue to mature and build out Pro capabilities, as well as to build new stores. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. We may also utilize strategic acquisitions, such as the GMS acquisition, to help accelerate our strategic initiatives.\nTEXT: In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.25 to $2.30 per share. During the first nine months of fiscal 2025, we paid cash dividends of $6.9 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022.

In the aggregate, as of November 2, 2025, our commercial paper program allows for borrowings up to $11.0 billion and is supported by $11.0 billion of back-up credit facilities.\nTEXT: On September 4, 2025, we utilized approximately $2.0 billion of commercial paper borrowings, together with cash on hand, to fund the GMS acquisition. These borrowings were subsequently repaid with the $2.0 billion of proceeds from our September 2025 senior notes issuance.\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2025, all of our short term borrowings were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding during that period was $4.3 billion. At November 2, 2025, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $3.2 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our back-up credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nTEXT: We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in September 2025, we issued $2.0 billion of senior notes, which were used to repay commercial paper borrowings used to fund the GMS acquisition. Separately, during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, we repaid an aggregate of $2.75 billion of senior notes at maturity.\nTEXT: The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various covenants, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We were in compliance with all such covenants at November 2, 2025. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nTITLE: CASH FLOWS SUMMARY\nTITLE: Operating Activities\nTEXT: Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.2 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by the timing of vendor payments, increased inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal 2025, and the deferral of our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This was partially offset by a reduction to our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments resulting from the OBBBA.\nTITLE: Investing Activities\nTEXT: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $12.1 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2024, primarily resulting from higher cash paid for acquisitions during fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Financing Activities\nTEXT: Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2025 primarily reflected $6.9 billion of cash dividends paid and $3.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $2.9 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments, and $2.1 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily reflected $10.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $1.3 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments, which were used to finance the SRS acquisition. This was partially offset by $6.7 billion of cash dividends paid, $1.4 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $649 million of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024.\n"

Under the Plan, participants surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock. Participants in the Plan may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plan are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plan and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.\nTEXT: (2)On August 14, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved on August 18, 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As previously disclosed, we paused share repurchases in March 2024 and have not resumed share repurchase activity as of November 2, 2025.\nTEXT: (3)Excludes excise taxes incurred on share repurchases.\nTITLE: SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we issued 461 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC’s Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in the plan.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, we credited 728 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plans pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in these plans.\n"
