These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof or as of the dates indicated in the statements and should not be relied upon as predictions of future events, as we cannot assure you that the events or circumstances reflected in these statements will be achieved or will occur.

Net revenue for the three months ended June 28, 2025 was $7.7 billion, a 32% increase compared to the prior year period. The increase in net revenue was driven by an increase in Client and Gaming segment revenue primarily driven by strong demand for the latest “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ processors and higher semi-custom sales, and an increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by growth in AMD EPYC™ CPU sales. Embedded segment revenue decreased as end market demand remained mixed.\nTEXT: Gross margin for the three months ended June 28, 2025 was 40% compared to gross margin of 49% for the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to approximately $800 million of inventory and related charges associated with the U.S. government export control on AMD Instinct™ MI308 Data Center GPU products.\nTEXT: Operating loss for the three months ended June 28, 2025 was $134 million compared to operating income of $269 million for the prior year period. The decrease in operating income was due to lower gross margin and higher operating expenses. Net income for the three months ended June 28, 2025 was $872 million compared to net income of $265 million for the prior year period. The increase in net income was primarily driven by the income tax benefit resulting from an $853 million release of uncertain tax positions pertaining to the reasonable cause relief for dual consolidated losses received from the Internal Revenue Services (IRS).\nTEXT: As of June 28, 2025, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.9 billion compared to $5.1 billion as of December 28, 2024. During the six months ended June 28, 2025, we generated $3.0 billion of cash from operating activities and we returned $1.2 billion to stockholders through the repurchase of common stock under our Repurchase Program.\nTEXT: On March 31, 2025 (the Acquisition Date), we completed the acquisition of ZT Group Int’l, Inc. (ZT Systems), which is expected to enable AMD to deliver end-to-end AI solutions and accelerate the design and deployment of AMD-powered AI infrastructure at scale optimized for the cloud. At the close of the acquisition, we paid $3.2 billion in cash and issued 8,335,849 shares of our common stock. To the extent contingencies are fully met, we will pay an additional $300 million in cash and issue up to 740,961 shares of our common stock.\nTEXT: At the time of the announcement of the ZT Systems acquisition in August 2024, we disclosed our intent to divest ZT Systems’ data center infrastructure manufacturing business (the ZT Manufacturing Business), while retaining only certain intellectual property and employees (the ZT Design Business). Accordingly, upon acquisition, we classified the ZT Manufacturing Business and its related assets and liabilities as held for sale. The results of the ZT Design Business and the ZT Manufacturing Business are presented within continuing operations and discontinued operations of AMD’s consolidated statements of operations and cash flows, respectively. The consolidated statements of operations include immaterial revenue attributable to the ZT Design Business, which is reported within the Data Center segment from the Acquisition Date.\nTEXT: On May 18, 2025, we entered into an equity purchase agreement (the Sale Agreement) with Sanmina Corporation to sell the ZT Manufacturing Business for $3.0 billion in cash and stock, inclusive of a contingent payment of up to $450 million, subject to customary adjustments for working capital and other items. The Sale Agreement provides that if the sale is not completed by May 18, 2026, subject to two automatic extensions until November 18, 2026, we will be entitled to receive a termination fee of up to $153 million. The transaction is expected to close near the end of 2025, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\nTEXT: We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n"

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to our revenue, inventories, goodwill, long-lived and intangible assets, business combination accounting and income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management’s expectations, the actual results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions.\nTEXT: Other than the estimates used in accounting for business combinations, management believes there have been no significant changes for the three and six months ended June 28, 2025 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.\nTEXT: Business Combinations. We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to assets and liabilities held for sale, intangible assets and contingent consideration. Significant estimates and inputs used in valuing acquired assets and liabilities held for sale, developed technology, and other identifiable intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future revenue, future changes in technology, useful lives, and risk-adjusted discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized.\nTITLE: Results of Continuing Operations\nTEXT: Beginning with the fiscal year ending December 27, 2025, we combined the Client and Gaming segments into one reportable segment to align with how we manage our business. Neither of the Client and Gaming businesses qualify as a separate reportable operating segment, however, we continue to separately disclose revenues for each business. All prior period segment data were retrospectively adjusted.\nTEXT: Our operating results tend to vary seasonally.
