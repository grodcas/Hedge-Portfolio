The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:\nTEXT: •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\nTEXT: •Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\nTEXT: •Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTEXT: Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, including organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 15\nTEXT: Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\nTITLE: OVERVIEW\nTEXT: P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\nTEXT: Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\nTITLE: Organizational Structure\nTEXT: Our organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n"

Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.\nTEXT: Our strategy is to deliver and sustain value creation through five integrated choices: a portfolio of daily-use products where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value; productivity; constructive disruption of the entire value chain; and a highly efficient and effective organization structure.\nTEXT: The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, plays to P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of product categories where P&G has strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies with typically leadership market positions.\nTEXT: Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.\nTEXT: Ongoing productivity improvement is strategic and crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and research and development programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate and manage through periods of challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity, inflation and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending.\nTEXT: We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.\nTEXT: We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.\nTEXT: Additionally, to further strengthen our integrated strategy, we have declared four focus areas. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4) delivering a superior employee value equation for all employees inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent to better serve our increasingly diverse consumer base.\nTEXT: We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.\nTEXT: The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:\nTEXT: •Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;\nTEXT: 18 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: •Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and\nTEXT: •Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.\nTEXT: While periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business.\nTITLE: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n"

During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded incremental restructuring charges of $801 million after tax, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were $1.2 billion after tax. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs were reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Intangible Asset Impairment\nTEXT: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge on an indefinite-lived intangible asset acquired as part of the Company’s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. For a more detailed discussion of the Gillette impairment, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Focused Portfolio, Supply Chain and Productivity Plan\nTEXT: In June 2025, the Company announced a portfolio and productivity plan to streamline its portfolio and organization to improve its cost structure and competitiveness. The Company expects to incur approximately $1.5 to $2.0 billion in before-tax restructuring costs over a two-year period, including costs incurred as part of this plan and the ongoing plan. The Company expects to incur half of the costs under this plan by the end of fiscal 2026, with the remainder incurred in fiscal 2027.\nTEXT: The restructuring activities will be executed across the Sector Business Units as well as the Enterprise Markets, Corporate Functions and Global Business Services. These restructuring activities include a plan for a reduction of up to 7,000 non-manufacturing overhead personnel by the end of fiscal 2027.\nTITLE: Glad Joint Venture Agreement\nTEXT: The Company and The Clorox Company (Clorox) have jointly decided not to renew the Glad joint venture agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, Clorox will purchase the Company’s minority interest in the venture at fair market value as of the agreement termination in January 2026.

Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 21% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for 1% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\nTEXT: For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025.\n"

The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-\nTEXT: 20 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\nTEXT: Our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.\nTEXT: For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2024 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: Net Sales\nTEXT: Net sales increased $245 million to $84.3 billion in fiscal 2025 as an increase in net sales driven by pricing of 1% was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%.

The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate.\nTEXT: Corporate net sales increased 32% to $794 million due to an increase in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings increased $903 million to a loss of $527 million due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year, partially offset by incremental restructuring charges in the current year, comprised primarily of the non-cash charge of $752 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.\nTITLE: Restructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost Savings\nTEXT: The Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of $250 to $500 million before tax. In fiscal 2024, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, and during the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the limited market portfolio restructuring. The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program were $1.2 billion after tax.\nTEXT: In fiscal 2025, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $1.1 billion, which include the non-cash charge of $752 million for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina. Restructuring accruals of $189 million as of June 30, 2025, are classified as current liabilities. Excluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for Argentina, approximately 74% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2025 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our policies for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.\nTEXT: Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.\nTITLE: CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nTEXT: We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\nTEXT: Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures.

Net earnings, adjusted for certain non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and loss on sale of assets) generated approximately $20.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts consumed $2.5 billion of cash in the period. Accounts receivable decreased slightly resulting in $45 million of cash flow help. Days sales outstanding were flat. Total inventories increased, consuming $324 million of cash, driven primarily by increased safety stock levels and higher commodity costs. These increased input costs and higher inventory levels resulted in a four-day increase in days on hand. Accounts payable decreased, resulting in $542 million use of cash, primarily driven by marketing and overhead activities. Other impacts reduced cash by $1.7 billion primarily driven by postretirement benefit impacts of $806, the payment of the transitional tax related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Act of $562 and a reduction in compensation and marketing accruals.\nTEXT: Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the 2017 U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.\nTEXT: Adjusted free cash flow was $14.6 billion in 2025, a decrease of 14% versus the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the divestiture of operations in Argentina, was 87% in 2025.\nTITLE: Investing Cash Flow\nTEXT: Net investing activities used $3.8 billion of cash in 2025, primarily due to capital expenditures.\nTITLE: Financing Cash Flow\nTEXT: Net financing activities used $14.0 billion of cash in 2025, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other and a net debt increase.\nTITLE: Liquidity\nTEXT: At June 30, 2025, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $10.7 billion, largely due to accounts payable, short-term borrowings and debt due within one year. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2025, the Company had $8.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nTEXT: We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\nTEXT: On June 30, 2025, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\nTEXT: We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in October 2029 and October 2025, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing.

While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we generally are able to negotiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not take-or-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTEXT: In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nTEXT: The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nTITLE: Revenue Recognition\nTEXT: Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\n"

Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, and our ability to uphold certain tax positions.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 27\nTEXT: Realization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.\nTEXT: We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.\nTEXT: A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTEXT: Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.

These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\nTEXT: The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2025, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $155 million.\nTEXT: Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $85 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.9% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $20 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.\n"

Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for those goodwill reporting units and intangible assets that do not have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have\nTEXT: 28 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.\nTEXT: As previously disclosed, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%. As of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.\nTEXT: The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\nTEXT: Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\nTEXT: The discount rate is based on a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n"

We leverage the Company's diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge and prioritize these operational hedging activities over financial market instruments. To the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operations, as discussed below, we enter into various financial transactions which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities.

The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors with a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results.

Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews critical accounting policies and estimates, financial reporting and internal control matters.\nTEXT: Global Internal Audit performs audits of internal controls over financial reporting as well as broader financial, operational and compliance audits around the world, provides training and continually improves our internal control processes. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes a robust Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually on critical financial reporting areas of the Company. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

The Company estimates fair value using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective asset. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty rate and discount rate. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both. The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of the Gillette Brand as of October 1, 2024. Because the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value, no impairment was recorded. As of June 30, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette Brand was $12.8 billion.\nTEXT: We identified the Company’s impairment evaluation of the Gillette Brand as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\nTITLE: Basis of Presentation\nTEXT: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n"

      "content": "ITEM 8:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nother, cash, costs, operating, which, cost, currency, investments, primarily, recorded\n\nTITLE: Revenue Recognition\nTEXT: Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\nTEXT: Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Cost of Products Sold\nTEXT: Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, customs and duties, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\nTITLE: Selling, General and Administrative Expense\nTEXT: Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.1 billion in 2025 and $2.0 billion in 2024 and 2023. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising expenses and were $9.2 billion in 2025, $9.6 billion in 2024 and $8.0 billion in 2023. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\nTITLE: Other Non-Operating Income, Net\nTEXT: Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses recognized upon the substantial liquidation of foreign operations and other non-operating items.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 41\nTITLE: Currency Translation\nTEXT: Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.\nTITLE: Cash Flow Presentation\nTEXT: The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at monthly exchange rates for each period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as investing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities.\nTITLE: Investments\nTEXT: The Company holds minor equity investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions. These are accounted for as equity method investments. Other equity investments that are not controlled, over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is a readily determinable market value, are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes. Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTEXT: The Company also holds highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and time deposits. Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Inventory Valuation\nTEXT: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.\n"

Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\nTITLE: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nTEXT: We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate several factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life.\nTEXT: The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.\nTEXT: For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.\nTITLE: Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nTEXT: Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and certain short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 42 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTITLE: New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies\nTEXT: On July 1, 2024, we adopted the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment was effective for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, and will be effective for our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. This standard was applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements and resulted in additional disclosures. See Note 2.\nTEXT: In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\". This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. The guidance will require additional disclosures in the Income Taxes footnote but will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”. This guidance requires disclosures about significant expense categories, including but not limited to, inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and selling expenses. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2028 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2029. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\nTEXT: No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital expenditures in the segments are on an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet. Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.\nTEXT: Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs.\nTEXT: The Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Chief Executive Officer. As the Company allocates taxes to individual segments, the CODM uses Earnings before income taxes and Net earnings to assess segment performance and allocate resources in the budgeting and forecasting process.

Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.\nTITLE: Other Costs\nTEXT: Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include accumulated foreign currency translation losses, asset removal and termination of contracts.

Goodwill decreased during fiscal 2024 primarily due to currency translation across all reportable segments and a brand divestiture in the Beauty reportable segment.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability). Significant judgment by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows. Estimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nTEXT: We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nTEXT: As previously disclosed, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 48 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of:\nTEXT: 20252024As of June 30Gross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationGross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationINTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVESBrands$4,449 $(3,019)$4,318 $(2,725)Patents and technology2,803 (2,722)2,794 (2,683)Customer relationships1,879 (1,236)1,834 (1,121)Other73 (31)72 (29)TOTAL$9,204 $(7,008)$9,019 $(6,558)INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVESBrands19,714 — 19,587 — TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS$28,918 $(7,008)$28,605 $(6,558)\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Brands — 2025: 4,449; 2024: (3,019)\nTABLE_ROW: Patents and technology — 2025: 2,803; 2024: (2,722)\nTABLE_ROW: Customer relationships — 2025: 1,879; 2024: (1,236)\nTABLE_ROW: Other — 2025: 73; 2024: (31)\nTABLE_ROW: TOTAL — 2025: 9,204; 2024: (7,008)\nTABLE_ROW: Brands — 2025: 19,714; 2024: 19,587\nTABLE_ROW: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS — 2025: 28,918; 2024: (7,008)\nTITLE: 20252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: As of June 30Gross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationGross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: As of June 30\nTITLE: Gross Carrying Amount\nTITLE: AccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: Gross Carrying Amount\nTITLE: AccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES\nTITLE: Brands$4,449 $(3,019)$4,318 $(2,725)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 4,449\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (3,019)\nTITLE: Patents and technology2,803 (2,722)2,794 (2,683)\nTITLE: 2,803\nTITLE: (2,722)\nTITLE: Customer relationships1,879 (1,236)1,834 (1,121)\nTITLE: 1,879\nTITLE: (1,236)\nTITLE: Other73 (31)72 (29)\nTITLE: 73\nTITLE: (31)\nTITLE: TOTAL$9,204 $(7,008)$9,019 $(6,558)\nTITLE: TOTAL\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,204\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (7,008)\nTITLE: INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES\nTITLE: Brands19,714 — 19,587 —\nTITLE: 19,714\nTITLE: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS$28,918 $(7,008)$28,605 $(6,558)\nTITLE: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 28,918\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (7,008)\nTITLE: Amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023Intangible asset amortization$320 $338 $327\nTEXT: Amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023Intangible asset amortization$320 $338 $327\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Intangible asset amortization — 2025: 320; 2024: 338; 2023: 327\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023Intangible asset amortization$320 $338 $327\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Intangible asset amortization$320 $338 $327\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 320\nTEXT: Estimated amortization expense over the next five fiscal years is as follows:\n"

For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations.\nTEXT: Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 3 - 5% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns.\nTEXT: Plan Assets. Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.\nTEXT: Our target asset allocation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, was as follows:Target Asset Allocation (1)Pension BenefitsOther RetireeBenefitsAsset CategoryCash1 %2 %Debt securities64 %1 %Equity securities35 %97 %TOTAL100 %100 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Pension Benefits Other RetireeBenefits; Cash 1 % 2 %; Debt securities 64 % 1 %; Equity securities 35 % 97 %; TOTAL 100 % 100 %.\nTITLE: Target Asset Allocation (1)\nTITLE: Pension BenefitsOther RetireeBenefits\nTITLE: Pension Benefits\nTITLE: Other RetireeBenefits\nTITLE: Asset Category\nTITLE: Cash1 %2 %\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Debt securities64 %1 %\nTITLE: 64\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Equity securities35 %97 %\nTITLE: 35\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 97\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: TOTAL100 %100 %\nTITLE: TOTAL\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTEXT: (1)Actual allocations approximated the targets.\nTEXT: The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (see Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles).

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 59\nTEXT: exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.\nTEXT: If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge. We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument.\nTITLE: Credit Risk Management\nTEXT: We have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter into transactions with investment grade financial institutions, to the extent commercially viable. Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments.\nTEXT: Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $1,061 and $307 as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.\nTITLE: Interest Rate Risk Management\nTEXT: Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.\nTEXT: We designate certain interest rate swaps on fixed-rate debt that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings.\nTITLE: Foreign Currency Risk Management\nTEXT: We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps. The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.\nTITLE: Net Investment Hedging\nTEXT: We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. The time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the net investment being hedged. The time value component is subsequently reported in income on a systematic basis.\nTITLE: Commodity Risk Management\nTEXT: Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. As of and during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity.\nTITLE: Insurance\nTEXT: We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract.\n"

Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the periods presented. When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year.\nTEXT: When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value.\nTITLE: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value\nTEXT: Cash equivalents were $8.3 billion and $8.0 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.\nTEXT: The fair value of long-term debt was $29.5 billion and $27.7 billion as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($5.3 billion as of June 30, 2025, and $3.8 billion as of June 30, 2024). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.\nTITLE: Disclosures about Financial Instruments\nTEXT: The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, are as follows:\nTEXT: Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)As of June 30202520242025202420252024DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSInterest rate contracts$3,280 $2,993 $— $— $(201)$(325)DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPSForeign currency interest rate contracts$11,874 $10,140 $— $119 $(860)$(31)TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,154 $13,133 $— $119 $(1,061)$(356)DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTSForeign currency contracts$3,576 $3,192 $19 $1 $— $(23)TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$18,730 $16,325 $19 $120 $(1,062)$(379)\nTABLE: TABLE: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability); As of June 30 2025 2024 2025 2024 2025 2024; Interest rate contracts $ 3,280 $ 2,993 $ — $ — $ (201) $ (325); Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 11,874 $ 10,140 $ — $ 119 $ (860) $ (31); TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,154 $ 13,133 $ — $ 119 $ (1,061) $ (356); Foreign currency contracts $ 3,576 $ 3,192 $ 19 $ 1 $ — $ (23); TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 18,730 $ 16,325 $ 19 $ 120 $ (1,062) $ (379).\nTITLE: Notional AmountFair Value AssetFair Value (Liability)\nTITLE: Notional Amount\nTITLE: Fair Value Asset\nTITLE: Fair Value (Liability)\nTITLE: As of June 30202520242025202420252024\nTITLE: As of June 30\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nTITLE: Interest rate contracts$3,280 $2,993 $— $— $(201)$(325)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,280\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (201)\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS\nTITLE: Foreign currency interest rate contracts$11,874 $10,140 $— $119 $(860)$(31)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 11,874\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (860)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS$15,154 $13,133 $— $119 $(1,061)$(356)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 15,154\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (1,061)\nTITLE: DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS\nTITLE: Foreign currency contracts$3,576 $3,192 $19 $1 $— $(23)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,576\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 19\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE$18,730 $16,325 $19 $120 $(1,062)$(379)\nTITLE: TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 18,730\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 19\nTITLE: $\n"

We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. Our operating lease agreements do not contain any material guarantees or restrictive covenants. The Company does not have any material finance leases or sublease activities. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material. The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 64 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: The components of the Company’s total operating lease cost for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023Operating lease cost$276 $252 $229 Variable lease cost (1)81 91 79 Total lease cost$357 $343 $308\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Operating lease cost — 2025: 276; 2024: 252; 2023: 229\nTABLE_ROW: Variable lease cost (1) — 2025: 81; 2024: 91; 2023: 79\nTABLE_ROW: Total lease cost — 2025: 357; 2024: 343; 2023: 308\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023Operating lease cost$276 $252 $229 Variable lease cost (1)81 91 79 Total lease cost$357 $343 $308\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202520242023\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Operating lease cost$276 $252 $229\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 276\nTITLE: Variable lease cost (1)81 91 79\nTITLE: 81\nTITLE: Total lease cost$357 $343 $308\nTITLE: Total lease cost\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 357\nTEXT: (1)Includes primarily costs for utilities, common area maintenance, property taxes and other operating costs associated with operating leases that are not included in the lease liability and are recognized in the period in which they are incurred.\nTEXT: Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows:\nTEXT: As of June 3020252024Operating leases:Right-of-use assets (Other noncurrent assets)$925$875Current lease liabilities (Accrued and other liabilities)255243Noncurrent lease liabilities (Other noncurrent liabilities)701666Total operating lease liabilities$956$909Weighted average remaining lease term:Operating leases6.0 years6.0 yearsWeighted average discount rate:Operating leases4.6 %4.5 %\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Right-of-use assets (Other noncurrent assets) — 2025: 925; 2024: 875\nTABLE_ROW: Current lease liabilities (Accrued and other liabilities) — 2025: 255; 2024: 243\nTABLE_ROW: Noncurrent lease liabilities (Other noncurrent liabilities) — 2025: 701; 2024: 666\nTABLE_ROW: Total operating lease liabilities — 2025: 956; 2024: 909\nTABLE_ROW: Operating leases — 2025: 6.0 years; 2024: 6.0 years\nTABLE_ROW: Operating leases — 2025: 4.6; 2024: 4.5\nTITLE: As of June 3020252024\nTITLE: As of June 30\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Operating leases:\nTITLE: Right-of-use assets (Other noncurrent assets)$925$875\nTITLE: Right-of-use assets (Other noncurrent assets)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 925\nTITLE: Current lease liabilities (Accrued and other liabilities)255243\nTITLE: 255\nTITLE: Noncurrent lease liabilities (Other noncurrent liabilities)701666\nTITLE: 701\nTITLE: Total operating lease liabilities$956$909\nTITLE: Total operating lease liabilities\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 956\nTITLE: Weighted average remaining lease term:\nTITLE: Operating leases6.0 years6.0 years\nTITLE: 6.0 years\nTITLE: Weighted average discount rate:\nTITLE: Operating leases4.6 %4.5 %\nTITLE: 4.6\n"

The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTEXT: The summary of the Company's outstanding obligation confirmed as valid under the SCF program is as follows:\nTEXT: 2025CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2024$5,559 Invoices confirmed17,132Confirmed invoices paid(16,999)Translation and other98 CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2025$5,790\nTABLE: TABLE: CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2024 $ 5,559; Invoices confirmed 17,132; Confirmed invoices paid (16,999); Translation and other 98; CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2025 $ 5,790.\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2024$5,559\nTITLE: CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2024\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5,559\nTITLE: CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2025$5,790\nTITLE: CONFIRMED OBLIGATIONS OUTSTANDING AT JUNE 30, 2025\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5,790\n"
