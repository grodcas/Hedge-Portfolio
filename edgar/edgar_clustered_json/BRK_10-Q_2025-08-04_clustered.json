Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.Significant estimates are used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, including those associated with evaluations of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on the amounts owed to us and the estimation of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts. These estimates may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Changes in macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, including changes in international trade policies and tariffs, may negatively affect our operating results and the values of our investments in equity securities and of our operating businesses.

Investments in equity securitiesOur investments in equity securities over the years have been concentrated in relatively few companies. The fair value of our five largest holdings at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 represented 67% and 71%, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our equity securities shown in the preceding tables. The five largest holdings at each date were American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation.Additionally, we own shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) common stock, which we account for under the equity method. See Note 5. Since 2019, we have also owned non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental and Occidental common stock warrants. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value. As of June 30, 2025, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion. To date, Occidental has redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value due to excess distributions, as defined under the terms of the Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations, to its common stockholders. The Occidental common stock warrants currently allow us to purchase up to 83.9 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.59 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. As of June 30, 2025, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 21.8% of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. The most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. As of June 30, 2025, we owned 27.4% of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and 28.1% of the outstanding Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental’s outstanding common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses.

Investments in equity securitiesOur investments in equity securities over the years have been concentrated in relatively few companies. The fair value of our five largest holdings at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 represented 67% and 71%, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our equity securities shown in the preceding tables. The five largest holdings at each date were American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation.Additionally, we own shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) common stock, which we account for under the equity method. See Note 5. Since 2019, we have also owned non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental and Occidental common stock warrants. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value. As of June 30, 2025, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion. To date, Occidental has redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value due to excess distributions, as defined under the terms of the Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations, to its common stockholders. The Occidental common stock warrants currently allow us to purchase up to 83.9 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.59 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. As of June 30, 2025, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 21.8% of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value.\nTITLE: Carrying Value Fair Value\nTITLE: Carrying Value\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: June 30, 2025 December 31, 2024 June 30, 2025 December 31, 2024\nTITLE: June 30, 2025\nTITLE: December 31, 2024\nTITLE: June 30, 2025\n"

In evaluating our investment in Kraft Heinz for other-than-temporary impairment in the second quarter of 2025, we considered our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value exceeds carrying value, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value, and the operating results and financial condition of the company. We also considered certain changes in circumstances that occurred in the second quarter of 2025. Berkshire’s representatives on the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors stepped down on May 19, 2025, and the timing and extent of financial information Berkshire receives is now limited to the information that Kraft Heinz makes available to the public. On May 20, 2025, Kraft Heinz announced that it was evaluating potential strategic transactions to enhance shareholder value, although Kraft Heinz indicated there was no assurance that its process will result in a transaction or assurance to its outcome or timing. Given these factors, as well as prevailing economic and other uncertainties, we concluded that the unrealized loss, represented by the difference between the carrying value of our investment and its fair value, was other-than-temporary. Accordingly, in the second quarter we recorded a pre-tax impairment loss of approximately $5.0 billion as a component of our equity in the earnings of Kraft Heinz, which reduced the carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz to fair value. As the timing and extent of financial information we receive from Kraft Heinz is now limited to the information Kraft Heinz makes publicly available, we believe that such information will no longer be available in time for concurrent inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, beginning with our second quarter of 2025, we are recognizing the equity method effects attributable to our investment in Kraft Heinz on a one-quarter lag. The carrying value of our investment in Kraft Heinz at June 30, 2025 was less than our proportionate share of Kraft Heinz shareholders’ equity.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim events that have occurred as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the preceding table related to events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses from significant catastrophe events (losses exceeding $150 million per event) in the first six months of 2025 were $1.1 billion from the Southern California wildfires, which occurred in the first quarter. We experienced no significant catastrophe events in the first six months of 2024. We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior accident years’ claims of $240 million in the first six months of 2025 and $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2024, which reduced losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.2% in 2025 and 1.1% in 2024.Our primary insurance businesses recorded net increases in prior accident years’ estimated ultimate claim liabilities of $266 million in the first six months of 2025, primarily attributable to increases for casualty exposures, partly offset by decreases for property coverages. Our primary insurance businesses reduced estimated losses for prior accident years in the first six months of 2024 by $433 million, which derived primarily from reduced estimates for property and medical professional liability coverages. Our reinsurance businesses recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior accident years in the first six months of $506 million in 2025 and $734 million in 2024. These reductions were primarily attributable to lower estimates for property coverages. Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Exposures include significant asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited.

Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follow (in millions).

On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,438,223 shares outstanding as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Berkshire is not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares under the program and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases during the first six months of 2025.Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 15.5% in the second quarter and 13.9% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 20.0% in the second quarter and 19.5% in the first six months of 2024. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a global minimum tax of 15%. While the U.S. has not adopted the Pillar Two rules, various countries are enacting legislation to adopt the rules. We do not currently have material operations in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and we do not currently expect these rules will materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two rules. Note 20.

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not currently believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and other Western states. HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”) is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE. Certain legal matters related to these entities are described below. PacifiCorp In September 2020, a severe weather event with high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries, loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. These wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate and included the Santiam Canyon, Beachie Creek, South Obenchain, Echo Mountain Complex, 242, Archie Creek, Slater and other fires. The Slater fire occurred in both Oregon and California. Third-party reports for these wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”) indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences, several other structures damaged, multiple individuals injured, and several fatalities. A significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred on federal and state lands in connection with certain of the 2020 Wildfires. In December 2024, the United States of America filed a complaint against PacifiCorp in conjunction with the correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil cover sheet accompanying the complaint demands damages estimated to exceed $900 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims. Amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximate $54 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages or punitive damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. Of the $54 billion, $51 billion represents the economic and noneconomic damages sought in the James mass complaints described below. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed.The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire discussed below are referred to as the “Wildfires.” Based on available information to date, we believe it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the 2020 Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (“USFS”), the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry (“ODF”), the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp.\nTITLE: 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\n"

The pace of changes in these events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first six months of 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the ultimate impact on our businesses, whether through changes in the availability of products, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services. It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings decreased $271 million in the second quarter and $1.5 billion in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. Underwriting results in the first six months of 2025 included after-tax losses of approximately $850 million from the Southern California wildfires, which occurred in the first quarter. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $47 million (1.4%) in the second quarter and $342 million (5.8%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to higher average short-term investment balances, partially offset by lower interest rates and dividend income, as well as the impact of capital distributions to Berkshire in the fourth quarter of 2024. The subsequent investment income earned on such distributions is included in other earnings in the above table.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF increased $239 million (19.5%) in the second quarter and $310 million (13.1%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily from improved operating efficiencies and productivity and from lower effective income tax rates. After-tax earnings of BHE increased $47 million (7.2%) in the second quarter and $427 million (31.1%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The earnings increases reflected higher earnings from the U.S. utilities and lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and reduced losses from the real estate brokerage businesses, primarily due to the impact of litigation settlement charges in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by lower earnings from the natural gas pipelines and other energy businesses.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased $221 million (6.5%) in the second quarter and $193 million (3.0%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. Results in 2025 among our numerous operations were mixed.\nTEXT: Investment gains (losses) derive from our investments in equity securities and can include significant unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices and foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of our investments. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.\n"

Further, we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume. We currently consider consolidated pre-tax losses exceeding $150 million from an event occurring in the current year to be significant. We incurred significant losses in 2025 from the Southern California wildfires in the first quarter, while we experienced no significant catastrophe events in the first six months of 2024.

The declines were primarily due to reductions at GUARD (36% year-to-date) and, to a lesser degree, at BHSI and RSUI, partially offset by higher volumes at NICO Primary, BHHC and BH Direct. GUARD’s premium declines reflected volume reductions across multiple product categories due to management’s decision to exit certain unprofitable lines and tightened overall underwriting standards beginning in 2024.

Losses incurred from the Southern California wildfires were approximately $300 million in the first six months of 2025. Losses incurred in 2025 also included increases in estimated ultimate losses for prior accident years’ claims of $401 million in the first six months, attributable to higher ultimate loss estimates in liability coverages, partly offset by lower ultimate loss estimates in property coverages. In the first six months of 2024, incurred loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims were reduced by $228 million. Casualty claim costs continue to be negatively impacted by unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of jury awards and litigation costs.\n"

Net earnings increased $167 million (62.5%) in the second quarter and $219 million (34.1%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. Pre-tax Wildfire loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, at PacifiCorp were $251 million in the second quarter of 2024. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires. Otherwise, net earnings of the U.S. utilities in the second quarter and the first six months of 2025 reflected comparative increases in electric utility margin, partially offset by an increase in energy operating expenses and lower other income.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $2.1 billion in the second quarter and $4.0 billion in the first six months of 2025, increases of $205 million (10.8%) and $430 million (11.9%), respectively, compared to 2024. The increases reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories, higher retail customer volumes and higher wholesale prices and volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.3% overall (up 9.0% at MEC, 2.0% at PacifiCorp and 0.3% at NV Energy) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and an overall favorable impact of weather. The increase in energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs.\nTEXT: Net earnings of natural gas pipelines declined $51 million in the second quarter and $62 million in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The decreases in earnings reflected higher interest expense, largely due to debt issued in January 2025 and debt refinancings in the fourth quarter of 2024 at higher interest rates, decreased margin on gas sales and lower other income, partially offset by higher transportation and storage revenues.\nTEXT: Net earnings of other energy businesses decreased $76 million in the second quarter and $11 million in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The decreases were primarily due to lower earnings at Northern Powergrid, from lower distribution revenue in the second quarter of 2025 due to lower tariffs from inflation adjustments and deferred income tax charges related to the March 2025 enactment of a change in the Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom, partially offset by favorable income tax expense from higher utilization of tax losses from upstream gas exploration and production activities.\nTEXT: Net earnings of real estate brokerage increased by $2 million in the second quarter and $146 million in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to charges in 2024 with respect to the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries and effectuated a nationwide class settlement. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The real estate brokerage business continues to be negatively impacted by the limited availability of homes for sale and high home prices.\nTEXT: Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings include BHE corporate interest expense and unallocated corporate and income tax expenses. Additionally, noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends include earnings attributable to non-Berkshire owners of BHE common stock and dividends on preferred stock held by other Berkshire subsidiaries.

The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International), a leader in drag reducing agents for pipelines (LiquidPower Specialty Products) and a structural steel fabrication products business (W&W|AFCO).\nTEXT: Revenues of the industrial products group were $9.5 billion in the second quarter and $18.6 billion in the first six months of 2025, increases of $270 million (2.9%) and $444 million (2.4%), respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024.

The increases reflected higher volumes and prices for aerospace products, partially offset by lower sales of power and general industrial products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 37.0% in the second quarter and 38.7% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The earnings increases reflected aerospace sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Earnings in the second quarter of 2025 included insurance recoveries associated with a fire at a fasteners facility that occurred in the first quarter of 2025, which mitigated the impact on earnings for the first six months of 2025.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the second quarter and $3.2 billion in the first six months of 2025, decreases of 4.9% and 4.8%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024. The declines were attributable to lower volumes and selling prices, partially offset by favorable product mix. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 11.6% in the second quarter and 18.7% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The declines were primarily due to lower volumes and selling prices, higher manufacturing costs, as well as restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2025, partially offset by lower raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $3.4 billion in the second quarter and $6.5 billion in the first six months of 2025, increases of 5.8% in the second quarter and 4.6% in the first six months compared to 2024. Seven of the twelve business groups generated higher revenues in the first six months of 2025. Rail & Leasing group revenues increased 14.3%, attributable to higher average lease rates and higher repair and sales volumes. Additionally, revenues in the first six months of 2025 increased in the Water Technologies (11.4%) and Transportation Products (3.9%) groups, primarily due to volume increases. Revenues increased in the Electrical group (4.0%), primarily due to copper price increases, and in the Plumbing & Refrigeration group (9.3%), attributable to volume and copper price increases. The largest revenue declines in the first six months of 2025 were experienced by the Metal Services (10.3%), Retail Solutions (9.9%) and Crane Services (11.4%) groups, reflecting a combination of reduced volumes and lower metals prices in Metal Services.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 6.9% in the second quarter and 2.3% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to reductions of liabilities accrued in connection with a prior business acquisition. Otherwise, operating results among the twelve business groups were mixed in each period. Earnings increases were generated in the Water Technologies, Plumbing & Refrigeration and Transportation Products groups, primarily attributable to a combination of increased volumes, business mix changes and cost management initiatives. Lower earnings were generated by the Electrical group due to lower margins in the building wire business and low demand in the utilities market. Additionally, earnings declined in the Metal Services group due to lower revenues. Rail & Leasing group earnings declined as increased maintenance costs on tank cars requiring regulatory inspection and maintenance procedures and reduced gains from asset sales more than offset the impact of the increases in revenues.\n"

Other retailing businesses include three jewelry businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’s Candies (confectionery products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies, school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based in Germany. Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”), which is primarily a retail business, is addressed separately since it is deemed a separate segment for financial reporting purposes.\nTEXT: Retailing group aggregate revenues increased 5.8% in the second quarter and 4.0% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. BHA’s revenues, which represented about 70% of our retailing group’s revenues in 2025, increased 7.1% in the second quarter and 6.1% in the first six months of 2025 as compared to 2024. The increases reflected higher new and pre-owned vehicle sales revenues, primarily due to increased units sold, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. BHA’s finance and insurance revenues increased 8.2% in the first six months of 2025, while service revenues increased 3.5% compared to 2024, primarily attributable to increased transaction volumes. Revenues of the other retailing businesses increased 2.9% in the second quarter and declined 1.1% in the first six months of 2025 versus 2024. Several of our other retailing businesses experienced sluggish customer demand in the first six months of 2025, attributable to a combination of increased competition and the impacts of higher economic uncertainty and changes in consumer confidence.\nTEXT: Retailing group pre-tax earnings increased $40 million (11.9%) in the second quarter and $16 million (2.5%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 8.0% in the second quarter and 4.2% in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to earnings increases from parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, partly offset by lower gross sales margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $20 million (23.9%) in the second quarter and declined $4 million (2.8%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The increase in the second quarter was primarily due to higher earnings from Nebraska Furniture Mart and seasonality effects at See’s Candies.\nTEXT: Pilot operates travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, and fuel-only retail locations. Pilot also operates large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing platforms in the U.S. We acquired the remaining 20% noncontrolling interest in Pilot on January 16, 2024.\nTEXT: Pilot’s revenues declined $2.9 billion (22.2%) in the second quarter and $5.0 billion (19.5%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. The declines were primarily attributable to significantly lower volumes from bulk fuel sales and fuel trading activities, as well as lower average fuel prices, partially offset by increased retail fuel volumes.\nTEXT: Pilot’s pre-tax earnings declined $80 million (40.2%) in the second quarter and increased $18 million (6.7%) in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. Earnings in 2025 were negatively impacted by lower gross sales margins and higher selling general and administrative expenses and were favorably affected by lower interest expense and gains from asset dispositions in the first quarter. The increases in selling, general and administrative expenses were primarily due to higher employee compensation and benefits, insurance and maintenance costs. The declines in interest expense were attributable to reduced borrowing levels and lower rates. Pilot’s borrowings are currently from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and approximate $3.9 billion at June 30, 2025, reflecting repayments of $1.6 billion since June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: Investment Gains (Losses)\nTEXT: A summary of investment gains (losses) follows (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Second Quarter First Six Months; 2025 2024 2025 2024; Investment gains (losses) $ 6,364 $ 23,857 $ (71 ) $ 25,733; Income taxes and noncontrolling interests 1,394 5,107 (3 ) 5,503; Net earnings $ 4,970 $ 18,750 $ (68 ) $ 20,230; Effective income tax rate 21.7 % 21.3 % 14.9 % 21.3 %.\nTITLE: Second Quarter First Six Months\nTITLE: Second Quarter\nTITLE: First Six Months\nTITLE: 2025 2024 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\n"

Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in equity securities also include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments in equity securities of non-U.S. issuers that are held by our U.S.-based subsidiaries.\nTEXT: Pre-tax investment gains and losses included unrealized gains of $7.6 billion in the second quarter and $1.2 billion in the first six months of 2025 and unrealized gains of $17.3 billion in the second quarter and $29.7 billion in the first six months of 2024, attributable to changes during the period in market prices on equity securities we held at the end of each period. Taxable investment gains and losses on equity securities sold, which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were gains of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $8.4 billion in the first six months of 2025 compared to gains of $59.6 billion in the second quarter and $73.7 billion in the first six months of 2024.\nTEXT: We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, are often meaningless in terms of understanding our reported consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economic performance.

After-tax investment income increased $545 million in the second quarter and $1.1 billion in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to increased investments in U.S. Treasury Bills, which derived largely from subsidiary dividends.\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses on Berkshire’s and BHFC’s senior notes represent the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates recognized in earnings from the periodic revaluation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior note liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given period can be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTEXT: Equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings of Kraft Heinz, Occidental and Berkadia. Occidental generated lower equity method earnings in the first six months of 2025 compared to 2024. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2025, we began recording our share of Kraft Heinz’s earnings on a one-quarter lag.\nTEXT: Acquisition accounting expenses include charges arising from the application of the acquisition method in connection with certain of Berkshire’s past business acquisitions. These charges are primarily from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with those acquisitions.

Berkshire’s shareholders’ equity at June 30, 2025 was $668 billion, an increase of $18.6 billion since December 31, 2024. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $17 billion for the first six months of 2025. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities usually produce significant volatility in our earnings.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We are not committed to a minimum or subject to a maximum repurchase amount. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. There were no share repurchases in the first six months of 2025.\nTEXT: At June 30, 2025, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of $339.8 billion. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities, excluding our equity method investments, were $283.0 billion.\nTEXT: Our consolidated borrowings at June 30, 2025 were $127 billion, predominantly issued by Berkshire and BHFC, or by BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Berkshire’s outstanding debt at June 30, 2025 was $21.9 billion, an increase of $770 million since December 31, 2024. In the first six months of 2025, Berkshire repaid approximately $1.6 billion of maturing debt. In April 2025, Berkshire issued ¥90 billion ($632 million) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.637%. Additionally, the carrying value of Berkshire’s non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt increased $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2025 due to foreign currency exchange rate losses. At the end of July 2025, Berkshire issued ¥151.5 billion ($1.0 billion) of senior notes maturing between 2030 and 2040 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.306%.\nTEXT: Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $18.3 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $393 million from December 31, 2024. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by Marmon’s railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest.\nTEXT: BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.9 billion as of June 30, 2025 an increase of $355 million since December 31, 2024. In the first six months of 2025, BNSF repaid term debt of approximately $530 million and in June 2025 issued $900 million of 5.8% debentures due in 2056. BHE’s aggregate borrowings were $58.1 billion at June 30, 2025, an increase of $1.75 billion from December 31, 2024. In the first six months of 2025, BHE subsidiaries issued approximately $2.7 billion of term debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% and maturity dates ranging from 2035 to 2055, and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt of $2.0 billion and increased short-term borrowings by $564 million. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.\nTEXT: In the first six months of 2025, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $21.0 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $9.1 billion in the first six months of 2025, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $6.2 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. BHE and BNSF forecast capital expenditures of approximately $8.8 billion over the remainder of 2025.\nTITLE: Contractual Obligations\nTEXT: We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as borrowings, operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities.\nTEXT: We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2025 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n"

Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Estimates” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2025 included estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $150.5 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2025 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $84.3 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.9 billion. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, our estimated fair values of seven reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimated aggregate fair value of these units at that time was approximately $65.6 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $57.4 billion. Goodwill of these reporting units totaled approximately $18.6 billion.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods and inputs may be used to estimate fair values, and significant judgments are required in making such estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on changes in market and economic conditions and events affecting our businesses, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.\nTEXT: Information concerning accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act.
