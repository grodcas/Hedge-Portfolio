Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nTEXT: The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nTEXT: The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nTEXT: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nTEXT: Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nTITLE: Form 10-Q15\nTITLE: 15\nTEXT: The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nTEXT: September 29, 2024December 31, 2023(Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $—472—472539Interest rate contracts(2)—985—985988Total —1,457—1,4571,527Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —461—461624Interest rate contracts(2) —4,487—4,4875,338Total —4,948—4,9485,962Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts —34—3464Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —32—3275Other Investments:Equity investments(3)505——5054,473Debt securities(4)—3,818—3,8188,874Other LiabilitiesContingent consideration(5)$——1,2221,2221,092\nTABLE: TABLE: September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023; (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total(1); Forward foreign exchange contracts $— 472 — 472 539; Interest rate contracts(2) — 985 — 985 988; Total — 1,457 — 1,457 1,527; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 461 — 461 624; Interest rate contracts(2) — 4,487 — 4,487 5,338; Total — 4,948 — 4,948 5,962; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 34 — 34 64; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 32 — 32 75; Equity investments(3) 505 — — 505 4,473; Debt securities(4) — 3,818 — 3,818 8,874; Contingent consideration(5) $— — 1,222 1,222 1,092.\nTITLE: September 29, 2024December 31, 2023\nTITLE: September 29, 2024\nTITLE: December 31, 2023\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Total(1)\nTITLE: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Total —1,457—1,4571,527\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Total —4,948—4,9485,962\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Other Investments:\nTITLE: Other Liabilities\nTEXT: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationSeptember 29, 2024December 31, 2023(Dollars in Millions)Total Gross Assets$1,4911,591Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(1,482)(1,575)Total Net Asset916Total Gross Liabilities4,9806,037Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(4,808)(5,604)Total Net Liabilities$172433\nTABLE: TABLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation September 29, 2024 December 31, 2023; Total Gross Assets $1,491 1,591; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (1,482) (1,575); Total Net Asset 9 16; Total Gross Liabilities 4,980 6,037; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (4,808) (5,604); Total Net Liabilities $172 433.\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationSeptember 29, 2024December 31, 2023\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\nTITLE: September 29, 2024\nTITLE: December 31, 2023\n"

The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal third quarter were $0.2 billion primarily related to the fair value of the inventory step-up and was recorded in Cost of products sold. The fiscal nine months were $0.7 billion of which $0.4 billion related to equity awards and was recorded in Other (income) expense. The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD IVL products with the average weighted lives of 14 years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk inherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The discount rate applied was 9.0%.\nTEXT: During the fiscal first quarter of 2024, on March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of approximately $2.0 billion, or $1.8 billion net of cash acquired. The Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $28.00 per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $2.3 billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $1.9 billion, goodwill for $0.3 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.5 billion, which includes deferred taxes of $0.4 billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to 70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%.

In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nTEXT: In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nTEXT: In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the presence of carcinogens, including asbestos.

In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements were finalized.\nTEXT: In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021 Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nTEXT: In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in March 2022.\nTEXT: The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nTEXT: In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining order staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other parties (the New Protected Parties).\nTEXT: Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained in force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted to proceed.\nTEXT: Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October 2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-precedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.\nTEXT: In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative claims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In December 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (\"LLT\").\nTEXT: Following the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were reactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery is proceeding, and a trial is scheduled to occur in December 2024. In March 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.\n"

As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.\nTEXT: On September 20, 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, seeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan was amended to, among other things, increase the proposed resolution by $1.75 billion.\nTEXT: Shortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue in the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. On September 23, 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order enjoining the commencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities, including the Company, until October 11, 2024. On September 24, 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S. Trustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. On October 10, 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion to transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court.\nTEXT: Mesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company separately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the State claims.\nTEXT: To account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $5.0 billion, through the third fiscal quarter 2024. As of September 29, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $12.0 billion (or nominal value of approximately $13.9 billion), net of payments made in fiscal 2024. Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss.\nTEXT: In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan (the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification from the Company.\nTEXT: In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nTEXT: In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain other protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights against the Company.\nTEXT: In July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities), and the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in their respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve their ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In October 2024, the Imerys Bankruptcy Court approved the Imerys Settlement Agreement. A joint hearing to consider approval of the Imerys and Cyprus disclosure statements is scheduled for October 28, 2024.\n"

(JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases were filed by state and local governments, which were subject to a final settlement in 2021. As of September 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except a number of school districts and public hospital systems. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTEXT: To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at trial or on appeal.\nTEXT: In July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle all remaining state and subdivision claims for up to $5.0 billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal third quarter 2024.\nTEXT: The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases. Counting the private litigant cases, there are approximately 20 remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 390 remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 3 additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these cases have been dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in 2025 or 2026.\nTEXT: In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; leave to appeal has been sought. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nTEXT: In November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed appealed the state court’s dismissal order, and briefing on the appeal concluded in October 2022. In February 2024, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of the shareholder's amended complaint. In March 2024, the shareholder filed a notice of petition for certification with the Supreme Court of New Jersey seeking review of the appellate court's decision. In May 2024, briefing on the shareholder's petition for certification concluded. In September 2024, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied the shareholder's petition for certification.\n"

Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\nTEXT: The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product or product category as of September 29, 2024:\nTITLE: Form 10-Q33\nTITLE: 33\nTEXT: Product or product categoryNumber of plaintiffs Body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder62,740DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System160PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System910Pelvic meshes6,190ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh160RISPERDAL10ELMIRON2,170\nTABLE: TABLE: Product or product category Number of plaintiffs; Body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder 62,740; DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System 160; PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System 910; Pelvic meshes 6,190; ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh 160; RISPERDAL 10; ELMIRON 2,170.\nTITLE: Product or product categoryNumber of plaintiffs\nTITLE: Product or product category\nTITLE: Number of plaintiffs\nTEXT: The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.

(DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nTITLE: DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nTEXT: Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled.

Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL.

Many of these matters involve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nTITLE: Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nTEXT: The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA (or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits typically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset.

The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. The growth was offset by declines of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales driven by net unfavorable patient mix and share loss primarily due to European biosimilar entrants partially offset by market growth, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA sales due to return of rights by Merck, Sharp & Dohme in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, and lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nTEXT: Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a result of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. In July 2024, a biosimilar version of STELARA launched in certain European markets for certain indications.\nTEXT: Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nTEXT: Infectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 2.4% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company does not anticipate any COVID-19 vaccine revenue in the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 1.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in Other Neuroscience.\nTEXT: Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 20.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and inventory dynamics. Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to competitive pressures.\nTEXT: Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 17.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) was driven by favorable patient mix, market growth and share gains. Sales growth of UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth, favorable patient mix and share gains partially offset by inventory dynamics in the U.S.\nTEXT: Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 7.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and share loss.\nTEXT: The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.\nTITLE: 46\nTITLE: MedTech\nTEXT: The MedTech segment sales in the fiscal nine months of 2024 were $23.7 billion, an increase of 4.1% as compared to the same period a year ago, with an operational increase of 5.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%. U.S. MedTech sales increased 6.7%. International MedTech sales increased by 1.6%, including an operational increase of 4.7% and a negative currency impact of 3.1%.

As of the fiscal nine months ending September 29, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.\nTEXT: In March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare purposes.\nTITLE: Conflict in the Middle East\nTEXT: Although the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal third quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal nine months ending September 29, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented approximately 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.\nTITLE: Other Macroeconomic Considerations\nTEXT: The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nTEXT: Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nTEXT: The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.\nTEXT: Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nTEXT: The Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents.

In the event the Company is not\nTITLE: Form 10-Q57\nTITLE: 57\nTEXT: successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.\nTITLE: Item 3 — Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\n"
