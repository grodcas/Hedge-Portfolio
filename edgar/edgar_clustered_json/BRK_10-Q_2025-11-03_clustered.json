General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.Significant estimates are used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, including those associated with evaluations of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on loans and other receivables and the estimation of losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts. These estimates may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Changes in macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, including changes in international trade policies and tariffs, may negatively affect our operating results and the values of our investments in equity securities and of our operating businesses. We are currently unable to reliably predict the nature, timing or magnitude of the potential economic consequences of any such changes or the impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements. As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, we reclassified the asset, liability, revenue and expense balances of Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) from the Railroad, Utilities and Energy sections to the Insurance and Other sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Earnings. Accordingly, we reclassified the Pilot balances in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 from the Railroad, Utilities and Energy section to the Insurance and Other section to conform with current presentations for comparability purposes. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated revenues, expenses or net earnings from the amounts previously reported.

ASU 2023-09 may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specific categories underlying certain expense captions on the income statement.

The fair value of our five largest holdings at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 represented 66% and 71%, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our equity securities shown in the preceding tables. The five largest holdings at each date were American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation.Additionally, we own shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) common stock, which we account for under the equity method. See Note 5. Since 2019, we have also owned non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental and Occidental common stock warrants. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method. The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value. As of September 30, 2025, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion. To date, Occidental has redeemed approximately $1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value due to excess distributions, as defined under the terms of the Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations, to its common stockholders. The Occidental common stock warrants currently allow us to purchase up to 83.9 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.59 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. As of September 30, 2025, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 22.0% of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. The most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. As of September 30, 2025, we owned 27.5% of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and 26.9% of the outstanding Occidental common stock, which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental’s outstanding common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. We also own a 50% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”). Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owns the other 50% interest. Berkadia engages in mortgage banking, investment sales and servicing commercial/multi-family real estate loans. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (limited to $1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. Our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental and Berkadia are summarized as follows (in millions). Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stocks are publicly-traded and the fair values are based on quoted market prices as of our balance sheet dates.

As such, Berkshire’s share of Kraft Heinz shareholders’ equity exceeded Berkshire’s equity method carrying value by approximately $5.0 billion at that time. This basis difference was attributed to Kraft Heinz’s indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. In evaluating our investment in Kraft Heinz for other-than-temporary impairment in the second quarter of 2025, we considered our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value exceeds carrying value, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value, and the operating results and financial condition of the company. Furthermore, Berkshire’s representatives on the Kraft Heinz Board of Directors stepped down on May 19, 2025. Since then, the timing and extent of financial information Berkshire receives regarding Kraft Heinz is limited to the information that Kraft Heinz makes available to the public. In May 2025, Kraft Heinz announced that it was evaluating potential strategic transactions to enhance shareholder value. On September 2, 2025, Kraft Heinz announced a plan to split Kraft Heinz into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off. Since the timing and extent of financial information we receive from Kraft Heinz became limited to the information Kraft Heinz makes publicly available, we concluded our receipt of such information was no longer sufficiently timely for concurrent inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Thus, we began recognizing the equity method effects attributable to our investment in Kraft Heinz on a one-quarter lag beginning with our second quarter of 2025. Our equity in earnings from Kraft Heinz in the first six months of 2025 included the $5.0 billion impairment loss we recorded in our second quarter, as well as our share of earnings Kraft Heinz reported in its first quarter of 2025. Our equity in earnings from Kraft Heinz for the third quarter of 2025 included our proportionate share of Kraft Heinz’s net earnings in the second quarter before our share ($2.4 billion) of the after-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset and goodwill impairment losses recognized by Kraft Heinz in its second quarter of 2025 (approximately $8.6 billion), which we applied to the basis difference that resulted from the impairment loss we recorded in our second quarter.

Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our primary insurance businesses recorded net decreases in prior accident years’ estimated ultimate claim liabilities of $284 million in the first nine months of 2025, attributable to decreases for property and workers’ compensation coverages, partly offset by increases in medical professional liability and other casualty coverages. In the first nine months of 2024, our primary insurance businesses increased estimated losses for prior accident years by $222 million, which reflected higher projected claim losses for certain commercial auto, business owner and other casualty coverages, partly offset by lower than expected property, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation losses. Our reinsurance businesses recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior accident years of $898 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to $1.2 billion in 2024. These reductions were primarily attributable to lower estimates for property coverages. Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date and may include significant asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims.

Berkshire repaid approximately $1.6 billion of maturing debt in the first nine months of 2025. In April 2025, Berkshire issued ¥90 billion ($632 million) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.6%. In July 2025, Berkshire issued ¥151.5 billion ($1.0 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2030 to 2040 and a weighted average interest rate of 2.3%.\nTEXT: Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured home loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $1.7 billion at September 30, 2025.

The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period on these borrowings are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.

Fair value measurementsThe fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data through correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follow (in millions).

Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times the average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Berkshire is not obligated to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares under the program and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no share repurchases during the first nine months of 2025.Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rates were 19.0% in the third quarter and 17.3% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 18.5% in the third quarter and 19.2% in the first nine months of 2024. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including realized and unrealized investment gains or losses on our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a global minimum tax of 15%. While the U.S. has not adopted the Pillar Two rules, various countries are enacting legislation to adopt the rules. We do not currently have material operations in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and we do not currently expect these rules will materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two rules. Note 20.

Supplemental cash flow information A summary of supplemental cash flow information for the first nine months of 2025 and 2024 follows (in millions). 2025 2024 Cash paid during the period for: Income taxes $ 8,652 $ 17,466 Interest: Insurance and other 1,079 1,163 Railroad, utilities and energy 2,883 2,645 Non-cash investing and financing activities Class B common stock issued in exchange for noncontrolling interests — 625 Note 22. Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not currently believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Utah, Oregon, Wyoming and other Western states. HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”) is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE. Certain legal matters related to these entities are described below. PacifiCorp In September 2020, a severe weather event with high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries, loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. These wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate and included the Santiam Canyon, Beachie Creek, South Obenchain, Echo Mountain Complex, 242, Archie Creek, Slater and other fires. The Slater fire occurred in both Oregon and California. Third-party reports for these wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”) indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences, several other structures damaged, multiple individuals injured, and several fatalities. A significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred on federal and state lands in connection with certain of the 2020 Wildfires. In December 2024, the United States of America filed a complaint against PacifiCorp in conjunction with the correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil cover sheet accompanying the complaint demands damages estimated to exceed $900 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims. Amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California total approximately $55 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages or punitive damages included in the complaints and excluding damages that may be sought by additional plaintiffs granted substitution counsel in the James class action lawsuit described below. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. Of the $55 billion, $52 billion represents the economic and noneconomic damages sought in the James mass complaints described below. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed.\nTITLE: 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\n"

The business segment data (Note 24 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nTEXT: Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods by the impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical conflicts and events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. These events, including tensions from developing international trade policies and tariffs, accelerated through the first nine months of 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the ultimate impact on our businesses, whether through changes in the availability of products, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services. It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results.\nTEXT: After-tax insurance underwriting earnings increased $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $86 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024. The comparative earnings increase in the third quarter was primarily attributable to lower incurred losses from current year significant catastrophe events and from prior accident years’ claims, as well as the impact of accruals in the third quarter of 2024 in connection with a bankruptcy settlement. Underwriting results in the first nine months of 2025 included after-tax losses of approximately $850 million from the Southern California wildfires, which occurred in the first quarter. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income declined $483 million (13.2%) in the third quarter and $141 million (1.5%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to lower interest rates, as well as the impact of capital distributions to Berkshire in the fourth quarter of 2024. The subsequent investment income earned on such distributions is included in “other” earnings in the above table.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF increased $66 million (4.8%) in the third quarter and $376 million (10.0%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily from core pricing gains, improved operating efficiencies and lower effective income tax rates. After-tax earnings of BHE declined $140 million (8.6%) in the third quarter and increased $287 million (9.6%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The earnings in the third quarter of 2025 were lower in the U.S. utilities, natural gas pipelines and other energy businesses, partially offset by lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. Earnings in the first nine months of 2025 included lower wildfire-related and real estate brokerage litigation accruals compared to 2024.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased $274 million (8.2%) in the third quarter and $467 million (4.8%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. Results among our numerous operations were mixed.\nTEXT: Investment gains (losses) can include significant unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities and in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of our investments. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices and exchange rates, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating our periodic economic performance. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.\n"

After-tax corporate investment income increased $533 million in the third quarter and $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to the impact of increased investments derived from subsidiary capital distributions to Berkshire. Foreign currency exchange rate changes on the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt produced after-tax gains of $331 million in the third quarter and after-tax losses of $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2025 compared to after-tax losses of $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $98 million in the first nine months of 2024.\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: Our periodic underwriting earnings may be subject to considerable volatility from the timing and magnitude of significant property catastrophe loss events. We currently consider consolidated pre-tax losses exceeding $150 million from an event occurring in the current year to be significant. We incurred significant losses from the Southern California wildfires in the first quarter of 2025 and from Hurricane Helene in the third quarter of 2024. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results.\nTEXT: We write primary insurance and reinsurance policies covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). We strive to generate pre-tax underwriting earnings (defined as premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except in our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. Time-value-of-money concepts are important considerations in establishing premiums for these policies, which are recognized as charges to earnings over the claim settlement periods.\nTEXT: Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months; 2025 2024 2025 2024; GEICO $ 1,773 $ 2,033 $ 5,767 $ 5,747; Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group 506 (689 ) 425 76; Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group 884 (310 ) 1,227 1,384; Pre-tax underwriting earnings 3,163 1,034 7,419 7,207; Income taxes 794 284 1,722 1,596; Net underwriting earnings $ 2,369 $ 750 $ 5,697 $ 5,611; Effective income tax rate 25.1 % 27.5 % 23.2 % 22.1 %.\nTITLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months\nTITLE: Third Quarter\nTITLE: First Nine Months\nTITLE: 2025 2024 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\nTEXT: GEICO writes property and casualty insurance policies, primarily private passenger automobile insurance, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Car/unit volumes increased 0.8% in the third quarter and 2.1% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024. Average revenue per car/unit increased 0.8% in the third quarter and declined 1.4% in the first nine months of 2025 versus 2024, generally attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue and unfavorable business mix, partially offset by core pricing gains. Pre-tax earnings increased 3.6% in the third quarter and 6.8% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2025, unchanged from 2024, and $6.1 billion in the first nine months, a decrease of 1.4% from 2024. The revenues in 2025 reflected lower average revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by slightly higher volumes. Volumes increased 2.2% in the third quarter and 3.7% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The volume increases were primarily due to higher intermodal shipments resulting from higher West Coast imports and an increase in automotive vehicle volumes.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2025, essentially unchanged from 2024, and $3.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025, a decrease of 1.4% from 2024. Revenues in 2025 reflected lower volumes of 1.9% for the third quarter and 3.8% year-to-date, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume declines were primarily due to lower demand for construction products and lower petroleum products shipments.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural and energy products were $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $4.8 billion in the first nine months of 2025, increases of 6.3% and 3.5%, respectively, compared to 2024. The revenue increases were attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit and slightly higher volumes. The volume increases were primarily due to slightly higher grain exports, partially offset by lower domestic grain and feed shipments.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal were $795 million in the third quarter of 2025, unchanged from 2024, and $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2025, an increase of 3.6% from 2024. Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 reflected higher average revenue per car/unit, which was offset by reduced volumes of 2.1% compared to 2024. The revenue increase in the first nine months of 2025 was primarily due to a 3.8% increase in volumes, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in the first nine months of 2025 was primarily due to the competitive effects of higher natural gas prices, while the volume decline in the third quarter was primarily due to mine production challenges.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $3.8 billion in the third quarter of 2025, essentially unchanged from 2024, and $11.4 billion in the first nine months of 2025, a decrease of $237 million (2.0%) compared to 2024. Fuel expenses declined $27 million (3.4%) in the third quarter and $235 million (9.5%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to lower average fuel prices and improved fuel efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 were relatively unchanged compared to 2024, reflecting wage inflation, offset by improved employee productivity. Other railroad operating expenses increased $48 million (3.0%) in the third quarter and decreased $21 million (0.4%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The changes in other railroad operating expenses included increases in purchased services and depreciation and amortization expenses, lower other expenses due to ongoing cost management efforts, as well as the impact of litigation accruals in the first nine months of 2024.\nTEXT: Income tax expense was unchanged in the third quarter of 2025 and declined $39 million (3.2%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 declined versus the same periods in 2024, primarily due to lower state income tax expenses arising from the impact of reductions in enacted rates during the second quarter of 2025.\nTITLE: BHE\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) is a holding company with subsidiaries that primarily operate within the energy industry.

Net earnings decreased $76 million (8.2%) in the third quarter and increased $143 million (9.1%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. Pre-tax Wildfire loss accruals, net of expected insurance recoveries, at PacifiCorp were $100 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 and were $251 million in the first nine months of 2024. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires. Otherwise, net earnings of the U.S. utilities in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2025 reflected comparative increases in electric utility margin, substantially offset by an increase in energy operating expenses and lower other income and income tax benefits.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $2.6 billion in the third quarter and $6.6 billion in the first nine months of 2025, increases of $163 million (6.8%) and $593 million (9.9%), respectively, compared to 2024. The increases reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories, higher retail customer volumes and higher wholesale prices and volumes, partially offset by higher energy cost of sales. Retail customer volumes increased 2.7% overall (up 9.8% at MEC, 2.0% at PacifiCorp and down 1.8% at NV Energy) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to higher customer usage and an increase in the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather. The increase in energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization expense, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs.\nTEXT: Net earnings of natural gas pipelines declined $41 million in the third quarter and $103 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The decreases in earnings reflected higher interest expense, largely due to debt issued in January 2025 and debt refinancings in the fourth quarter of 2024 at higher interest rates, an increase in operating expenses, decreased margin on gas sales and lower other income, partially offset by higher transportation and storage revenues.\nTEXT: Net earnings of other energy businesses decreased $99 million in the third quarter and $110 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The decreases were primarily due to lower earnings at Northern Powergrid, from lower distribution revenues due to lower tariffs from inflation adjustments beginning in the second quarter of 2025, deferred income tax charges related to the March 2025 enactment of a change in the United Kingdom’s Energy Profits Levy income tax and higher operating expenses at the distribution businesses, partially offset by favorable income tax expense from higher utilization of tax losses from upstream gas exploration and production activities.\nTEXT: Net earnings of real estate brokerage increased by $13 million in the third quarter and $159 million in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to charges in 2024 with respect to the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries and effectuated a nationwide class settlement. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. The real estate brokerage business continues to be negatively impacted by the limited availability of homes for sale and high home prices.\nTEXT: Corporate interest and other net earnings include BHE corporate interest expense and unallocated corporate and income tax expenses. Additionally, noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends include earnings attributable to non-Berkshire owners of BHE common stock and dividends on preferred stock held by other Berkshire subsidiaries.

PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 35.6% in the third quarter and 37.6% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The earnings increases reflected the aerospace sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Earnings in the third quarter and first nine months of 2025 also included insurance recoveries associated with a fire at a fasteners facility that occurred in the first quarter of 2025, which mitigated the earnings impact from the fire.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the third quarter and $4.75 billion in the first nine months of 2025, decreases of 1.4% and 3.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2024. The declines were attributable to lower volumes and selling prices across most regions and markets, partially offset by favorable product mix. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 2.7% in the third quarter and 13.8% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The declines were primarily due to lower selling prices and volumes, higher manufacturing costs and restructuring and non-recurring charges, partially offset by lower raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses and favorable product mix.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $3.2 billion in the third quarter and $9.7 billion in the first nine months of 2025, increases of 4.3% in the third quarter and 4.5% in the first nine months compared to 2024. In the first nine months of 2025, Rail & Leasing group revenues increased 9.5%, attributable to higher average lease rates and higher repair and sales volumes, while revenues increased in the Water Technologies (11.6%) and Transportation Products (5.5%) groups, primarily due to volume increases. Additionally, revenues increased in the Plumbing & Refrigeration group (11.0%) due to higher volumes and copper prices and the Electrical group (4.7%), principally due to higher copper prices. These increases were partially offset by revenue declines in the Metal Services group (8.1%) due to lower demand and the Crane Services group (11.6%), attributable to lower volumes and prices.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 19.7% in the third quarter and 7.5% in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. The comparative increase in earnings in the third quarter of 2025 was driven by the Rail & Leasing, Transportation Products, Retail Solutions and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups. The Rail & Leasing group’s earnings increase reflected higher lease rates, gains from asset sales and improved operational efficiencies in the repair operations. The third quarter earnings increase in the Transportation Products and Retail Solutions groups were primarily attributable to higher revenues, whereas the earnings increase in the Plumbing & Refrigeration group reflected higher volumes and copper spreads. Operating results among the twelve business groups for the first nine months of 2025 were mixed compared to 2024. The Plumbing & Refrigeration, Transportation Products, Water Technologies, Retail Solutions, Rail & Leasing, Industrial Products and Specialty groups contributed meaningful increases in earnings, due to a combination of higher revenue, copper spreads and operating margins. These increases were partially offset by declines in the Electrical and Metal Services groups. Earnings in the first nine months of 2025 also included income from the reduction and settlement of liabilities in connection with a prior business acquisition.\n"

The increases in financial services earnings were primarily due to lower insurance claims and higher interest income, partially offset by increases in interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates. Interest expense increased $252 million in the first nine months of 2025 versus 2024, largely attributable to increased borrowings. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page 49.\nTEXT: Other building products businesses revenues were $3.7 billion in the third quarter of 2025, relatively unchanged from 2024, and $10.6 billion in the first nine months of 2025, a decline of 2.1% compared to 2024. The year-to-date decline generally reflected lower unit volumes, pricing pressures and the impact of a divesture in 2025. Pre-tax earnings of our other building products businesses increased $7 million (1.2%) in the third quarter and declined $116 million (6.6%) in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024.

In the third quarter of 2025, Duracell determined certain of its battery product components manufactured in the U.S. were eligible for the refundable advanced manufacturing production income tax credits beginning in the 2023 tax year. Duracell recorded the eligible credits for the 2023, 2024 and first nine months of 2025 periods in the third quarter of 2025. Under U.S. GAAP, these credits are reflected in pre-tax earnings, not as income tax expense. Before the impact of these credits, pre-tax earnings of the consumer products group declined significantly in the third quarter and in the first nine months of 2025 compared to 2024. These declines were primarily attributable to lower earnings from Jazwares, Forest River, Duracell, and Fruit of the Loom, generally reflecting lower gross margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses, as percentages of revenues and were partially offset by higher earnings from Brooks Sports, attributable to a combination of increased sales and gross margins.\nTEXT: A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months; 2025 2024 2025 2024; Service $ 5,752 $ 5,130 $ 16,922 $ 15,492; McLane 13,191 12,723 37,967 37,656; Retailing 4,841 4,712 14,496 14,000; Pilot 10,882 10,630 31,421 36,132; $ 34,666 $ 33,195 $ 100,806 $ 103,280; Service $ 678 $ 569 $ 2,055 $ 1,793; McLane 173 145 530 452; Retailing 302 308 971 961; Pilot (17 ) 217 270 486; $ 1,136 $ 1,239 $ 3,826 $ 3,692; Service 11.8 % 11.1 % 12.1 % 11.6 %; McLane 1.3 1.1 1.4 1.2; Retailing 6.2 6.5 6.7 6.9; Pilot (0.2 ) 2.0 0.9 1.3.\nTITLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months\nTITLE: Third Quarter\nTITLE: First Nine Months\nTITLE: 2025 2024 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues:\nTEXT: Our service businesses include NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components.

Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Estimates” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2025 included estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $151.1 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2025 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $84.5 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $19.0 billion. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, our estimated fair values of seven reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimated aggregate fair value of these units at that time was approximately $65.6 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $57.4 billion. Goodwill of these reporting units totaled approximately $18.6 billion.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods and inputs may be used to estimate fair values, and significant judgments are required in making such estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2025, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on changes in market and economic conditions and events affecting our businesses, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.\nTEXT: Information concerning accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"
