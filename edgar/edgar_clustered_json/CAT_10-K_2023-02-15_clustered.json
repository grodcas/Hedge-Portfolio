The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. Profit per share was $12.64 in 2022, compared with profit per share of $11.83 in 2021. Profit was $6.705 billion in 2022, compared with $6.489 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs, a goodwill impairment charge, higher selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses, lower mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans and higher restructuring costs.\n"

We expect non-residential construction in North America to grow due to the positive impact of government-related infrastructure investments, healthy backlogs and rental replenishment. Residential construction continues to moderate due to tightening financial conditions but remains at a healthy level. In Asia Pacific, excluding China, we expect growth due to public infrastructure spending and supportive commodity prices. We expect continued weakness in China in the excavator industry above 10-tons, which we anticipate to remain below 2022 levels due to low construction activity. In EAME, business activity is expected to be about flat versus 2022 based on healthy backlogs and strong construction demand in the Middle East, offset by uncertain economic conditions in Europe. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to be flat to slightly down versus a strong 2022 performance.\nTEXT: In Resource Industries, we expect healthy mining demand to continue as commodity prices remain above investment thresholds; however, customers continue to remain capital disciplined. We anticipate production and utilization levels will remain elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to gain momentum. We expect the continuation of high equipment utilization and a low level of parked trucks, which support future demand for our equipment and services. The energy transition is expected to support increased commodity demand, expanding our total addressable market and providing opportunities for profitable growth. In heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we anticipate continued growth supported by infrastructure and major non-residential construction projects.\nTEXT: In Energy & Transportation, we expect sales growth due to strong order rates in most applications. In Oil & Gas, although customers remain disciplined, we are encouraged by continued strength in demand and order intake for the year. New equipment orders for Solar Turbines continue to be robust. Power Generation orders are expected to remain healthy, including data center strength. Industrial remains healthy with momentum continuing for 2023. In Rail, North America new locomotives are expected to remain muted. We anticipate strength in high-speed marine as customers continue to upgrade aging fleets.\nTEXT: Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: For the full-year 2023, we expect sales to increase compared to 2022, supported by favorable price realization. Although we expect stronger sales of equipment to end users in 2023, we do not anticipate a significant change in dealer inventory by year end. 2023 sales are expected to follow a more traditional seasonal pattern, with first quarter being the lowest of the year. Demand remains strong given the robust order backlog and improving supply chain dynamics. In addition, services momentum is expected to continue this year as we continue to execute our services growth strategy.\nTEXT: We expect sales to increase in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by favorable price realization and slightly stronger sales volume, which reflects higher sales of equipment to end users. We expect a seasonal build in dealer inventory in the first quarter of 2023. Sales should increase across the three primary segments in the first quarter of 2023, compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nTEXT: We expect operating profit to increase in 2023, compared to 2022. Pricing actions from 2022 will continue to impact 2023 and we will evaluate future actions as appropriate to offset inflationary pressures. We currently expect to see moderation of price realization and input cost inflation throughout 2023. Price realization is expected to more than offset manufacturing costs for 2023. Increases in SG&A/R&D expenses are expected to exceed the benefit of lower short-term incentive compensation expense in 2023 as we continue to invest in strategic initiatives such as services growth and technology, including digital, electrification and autonomy. We anticipate higher pension expense within other income (expense) in 2023, compared to 2022, due to higher interest costs from higher interest rates. This non-cash item is estimated to be just over $300 million for the full year, or about $80 million per quarter. Finally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in 2022 acted as a benefit to profit within other income (expense), which would not re-occur if the weakening we have seen in rates continues.\nTEXT: We continue to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures. Areas of particular focus include certain components, transportation and raw materials. Transportation shortages have resulted in delays and increased costs. In addition, our suppliers are dealing with availability issues and freight delays, which could impact production in our facilities. Contingency plans have been developed and continue to be modified to minimize supply chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing customer demand. We continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs.\nTEXT: Risk factors are disclosed within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the 2022 Form 10-K.\nTEXT: •Glossary of terms included on pages 35-37; first occurrence of terms shown in bold italics.\nTEXT: •Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on page 49.\nTEXT: •Some amounts within this report are rounded to the millions or billions and may not add.

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s Board of Directors and employees.\nTEXT: Total sales and revenues for 2022 were $59.427 billion, an increase of $8.456 billion, or 17 percent, compared with $50.971 billion in 2021. The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts related to the euro, Australian dollar and Japanese yen. The increase in sales volume was driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories, increased services and higher sales of equipment to end users.

Dealers increased their inventories during 2022, compared to remaining about flat during 2021.\nTEXT: Dealers increased their inventories about $2.4 billion in 2022, compared to a decrease of about $100 million in 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We expect dealer inventories to be about flat in 2023 compared to 2022.\nTEXT: Sales and Revenues by Segment(Millions of dollars)2021SalesVolumePriceRealizationCurrencyInter-Segment / Other2022$Change%ChangeConstruction Industries$22,106 $1,231 $2,633 $(731)$30 $25,269 $3,163 14 %Resource Industries9,810 1,372 1,333 (194)(7)12,314 2,504 26 %Energy & Transportation20,287 1,972 1,216 (521)798 23,752 3,465 17 %All Other Segment511 3 4 (7)(61)450 (61)(12 %)Corporate Items and Eliminations(4,526)82 (7)— (760)(5,211)(685) Machinery, Energy & Transportation48,188 4,660 5,179 (1,453)— 56,574 8,386 17 %Financial Products Segment3,073 — — — 180 3,253 180 6 %Corporate Items and Eliminations(290)— — — (110)(400)(110) Financial Products Revenues2,783 — — — 70 2,853 70 3 %Consolidated Sales and Revenues$50,971 $4,660 $5,179 $(1,453)$70 $59,427 $8,456 17 %\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2021 SalesVolume PriceRealization Currency Inter-Segment / Other 2022 $Change %Change; Construction Industries $ 22,106 $ 1,231 $ 2,633 $ (731) $ 30 $ 25,269 $ 3,163 14 %; Resource Industries 9,810 1,372 1,333 (194) (7) 12,314 2,504 26 %; Energy & Transportation 20,287 1,972 1,216 (521) 798 23,752 3,465 17 %; All Other Segment 511 3 4 (7) (61) 450 (61) (12 %); Corporate Items and Eliminations (4,526) 82 (7) — (760) (5,211) (685); Machinery, Energy & Transportation 48,188 4,660 5,179 (1,453) — 56,574 8,386 17 %; Financial Products Segment 3,073 — — — 180 3,253 180 6 %; Corporate Items and Eliminations (290) — — — (110) (400) (110); Financial Products Revenues 2,783 — — — 70 2,853 70 3 %; Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 50,971 $ 4,660 $ 5,179 $ (1,453) $ 70 $ 59,427 $ 8,456 17 %.\nTITLE: Sales and Revenues by Segment\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)2021SalesVolumePriceRealizationCurrencyInter-Segment / Other2022$Change%Change\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2021\nTITLE: SalesVolume\nTITLE: PriceRealization\nTITLE: Currency\nTITLE: Inter-Segment / Other\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: $Change\nTITLE: %Change\nTITLE: Construction Industries$22,106 $1,231 $2,633 $(731)$30 $25,269 $3,163 14 %\nTITLE: Construction Industries\nTITLE: Resource Industries9,810 1,372 1,333 (194)(7)12,314 2,504 26 %\nTITLE: Resource Industries\nTITLE: Energy & Transportation20,287 1,972 1,216 (521)798 23,752 3,465 17 %\nTITLE: Energy & Transportation\nTITLE: All Other Segment511 3 4 (7)(61)450 (61)(12 %)\nTITLE: All Other Segment\nTITLE: Corporate Items and Eliminations(4,526)82 (7)— (760)(5,211)(685)\nTITLE: Corporate Items and Eliminations\nTITLE: Machinery, Energy & Transportation48,188 4,660 5,179 (1,453)— 56,574 8,386 17 %\nTITLE: Machinery, Energy & Transportation\nTITLE: Financial Products Segment3,073 — — — 180 3,253 180 6 %\nTITLE: Financial Products Segment\nTITLE: Financial Products Revenues2,783 — — — 70 2,853 70 3 %\nTITLE: Financial Products Revenues\nTITLE: Consolidated Sales and Revenues$50,971 $4,660 $5,179 $(1,453)$70 $59,427 $8,456 17 %\n"

The increase was primarily due to favorable price realization and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher manufacturing costs, a goodwill impairment charge, higher SG&A/R&D expenses and higher restructuring costs.\nTEXT: Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher material costs, freight and manufacturing inefficiencies. The increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was driven by investments aligned with the company's strategy for profitable growth, which included services growth and technology, such as digital, electrification and autonomy, as well as higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\nTEXT: Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually.

The company’s settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) from certain parts transactions. We vigorously contested the IRS’s application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with the associated interest of $250 million. The settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and enables us to avoid the costs and burdens of further disputes with the IRS. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years’ taxes and related interest, net of tax. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination.\nTEXT: The provision for income taxes also included the following:\nTEXT: ◦A tax charge of $124 million related to $606 million of pension and OPEB mark-to-market gains in 2022, compared to a $190 million tax charge related to $833 million of mark-to-market gains in 2021.\nTEXT: ◦A tax benefit of $49 million to reflect other changes in estimates related to prior year’s U.S. taxes in 2022 compared to $36 million in 2021.\nTEXT: ◦A tax benefit of $36 million related to the $925 million goodwill impairment charge in 2022.\nTEXT: ◦A tax benefit of $33 million in 2022, compared with $63 million in 2021, for the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.\nTEXT: ◦A tax benefit of $38 million in 2021 to recognize U.S. capital losses.\nTITLE: Construction Industries\nTEXT: Construction Industries’ total sales were $25.269 billion in 2022, an increase of $3.163 billion, or 14 percent, compared with $22.106 billion in 2021.

These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.\nTEXT: We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Moody’s, Fitch and S&P maintain a “mid-A” debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&T’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.\nTEXT: We facilitate voluntary supply chain finance programs (the “Programs”) through participating financial institutions. The Programs are available to a wide range of suppliers and allow them the option to manage their cash flow. We are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the Programs. The range of payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers is consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the Programs. The amounts payable to participating financial institutions for suppliers who voluntarily participate in the Programs and included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position were $862 million and $822 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. The amounts settled through the Programs and paid to participating financial institutions were $5.4 billion and $4.1 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We account for payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of supply chain financing will have a significant impact on our liquidity.\nTITLE: Material cash requirements for contractual obligations\nTEXT: We believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $7.00 billion and available-for-sale debt securities of $1.48 billion as of December 31, 2022, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\nTEXT: We have committed cash outflows related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.\nTEXT: We have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2022, but scheduled for payment in 2023 of $8.69 billion. In addition, we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2022, but not yet invoiced or delivered, of $7.64 billion.\nTEXT: We also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development contracts; information technology consulting contracts and outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration. These obligations total $1.06 billion, with $537 million due in the next 12 months.\n"

The decrease was primarily due to payments for short-term incentive compensation in the first quarter of 2022, higher payments for taxes which includes payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and increased working capital requirements in 2022. Within working capital, changes in accounts payable unfavorably impacted cash flow but were partially offset by favorable changes in customer advances and accounts receivable. Partially offsetting these items were higher profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items.\nTEXT: Net cash used for investing activities in 2022 was $1.81 billion, compared with net cash used of $1.23 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to decreased activity related to intercompany lending with Financial Products and was partially offset by decreases in net investment activity.\nTEXT: Net cash used for financing activities during 2022 was $6.80 billion, compared with net cash used of $6.30 billion in 2021. The change was primarily due to higher share repurchases in 2022 and the absence of proceeds from debt issuance which occurred in 2021. These items were partially offset by lower repayments of maturing debt in 2022.\nTEXT: While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows:\nTEXT: Strong financial position — Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.\nTEXT: Operational excellence and commitments — Capital expenditures were $1.30 billion during 2022, compared to $1.13 billion in 2021. We expect ME&T’s capital expenditures in 2023 to be around $1.5 billion. We made $346 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans during 2022. In comparison, we made $340 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2021. We expect to make approximately $372 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2023.\nTEXT: Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings and services, including acquisitions.\nTEXT: As part of our capital allocation strategy, ME&T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We define ME&T free cash flow as cash from ME&T operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions and cash payments related to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.\nTEXT: Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company and the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. In July 2018, the Board of Directors approved an authorization to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock (the 2018 Authorization) effective January 1, 2019, with no expiration. In May 2022, the Board approved a new share repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022 with no expiration. Utilization of the 2022 Authorization for all share repurchases commenced on August 1, 2022, leaving $70 million unutilized under the 2018 Authorization. In 2022, we repurchased $4.23 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $12.8 billion remaining under the 2022 Authorization as of December 31, 2022. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 were approximately 516 million.\nTEXT: Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers the economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In December 2022, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.20 per share and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. Dividends paid totaled $2.44 billion in 2022.\n"

The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.\nTEXT: Residual values for leased assets – We determine the residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\nTEXT: Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price.\nTEXT: During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\nTEXT: We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.\nTEXT: At December 31, 2022, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.71 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $80 million of additional annual depreciation expense.\nTEXT: Fair values for goodwill impairment tests – We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\nTEXT: We review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.\nTEXT: For reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. We compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit’s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\nTEXT: Our annual impairment tests completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was substantially above its respective carrying value, including goodwill, with the exception of our Rail reporting unit.\n"

      "content": "ITEM 7:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nrate, impairment, benefit, discount, reporting, assumptions, rates, rail, value, cash\n\nTEXT: The Rail reporting unit is a part of our Energy & Transportation segment. Rail’s product portfolio includes diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated that the fair value of Rail was below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million, resulting in a full impairment of Rail’s goodwill balance as of October 1, 2022. There was a $36 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The valuation of the Rail reporting unit was based on estimates of future cash flows, which assumed a reduced demand forecast, lower margins due to continued inflationary cost pressures, and a discount rate approximately 140 basis points higher than utilized in the prior year valuation. The reduction in the demand forecast in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by fourth quarter commercial developments, resulting in a lower outlook for the Company’s locomotive offerings.\nTEXT: An unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial performance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth and profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting units. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. We would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.\nTEXT: Warranty liability – At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. We determine the warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\nTEXT: Product liability and insurance loss reserve – We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2022 and 2021 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\nTEXT: Postretirement benefits – We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\nTEXT: Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\nTEXT: •We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate would increase our obligation and expense.\n"

We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. We adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.\nTEXT: Allowance for credit losses - The allowance for credit losses is management’s estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. In addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and company-specific factors. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\nTEXT: We measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. We identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees.\nTEXT: While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.\nTEXT: Income taxes – We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.\nTEXT: Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n"

Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. In making this assessment, management analyzes the trend of U.S. GAAP earnings and estimates the impact of future taxable income, reversing temporary differences and available prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We give less weight in this analysis to mark-to-market adjustments to remeasure our pension and OPEB plans as we do not consider these adjustments indicative of ongoing earnings trends. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nTEXT: Additional information related to income taxes is included in Note 6 - “Income taxes” of Part II, Item 8 “Financial statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTITLE: OTHER MATTERS\nTEXT: Information related to legal proceedings appears in Note 22—Environmental and Legal Matters of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTITLE: RETIREMENT BENEFITS\nTEXT: We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans.

This expected increase is primarily due to higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022 (U.S. pension plans discount rate for 2023 interest cost is 5.2 percent compared to 2.3 percent for 2022) which is partially offset by higher expected return on plan assets in 2023 (U.S. pension plans expected return on plans assets is 5.8 percent for 2023 compared to 4.0 percent in 2022).\nTEXT: •Increase in expense in 2022 compared to 2021 - Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2022 compared to 2021 and higher interest cost in 2022 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2021.\nTEXT: •Decrease in expense in 2021 compared to 2020 - Primarily due to mark-to-market gains in 2021 compared to mark-to-market losses in 2020 and lower interest cost in 2021 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2020.\nTEXT: The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2022, 2021 and 2020 are described below.

Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2023 cash flow for our ME&T operations by approximately $98 million. Last year similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $89 million adverse impact on 2022 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.\nTEXT: In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.\nTEXT: The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Mexican peso, Indian rupee and Euro.\nTITLE: Interest Rate Sensitivity\nTEXT: For our ME&T operations, we have the option to use interest rate contracts to lower the cost of borrowed funds by attaching fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts to fixed-rate debt, and by entering into forward rate agreements on future debt issuances. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2023 pre-tax earnings of ME&T. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. Match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2022 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2023 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2022 pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.\n"

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nTEXT: Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2022, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nTEXT: The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nTEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nTEXT: Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nTITLE: Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTEXT: Caterpillar SARL (“CSARL”) Internal Revenue Services (“IRS”) Settlement\nTEXT: As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 8, 2022, management reached a settlement with the IRS that resolved all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016, without any penalties. The Company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by CSARL from certain parts transactions. The IRS previously proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties based on application of the “substance-over-form” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines, but the settlement did not include any increases to tax in the United States based on the judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with associated interest of $250 million. As a result of the settlement, the Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of $41 million within the provision (benefit) for income taxes of $2,067 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTEXT: The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the CSARL IRS settlement is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in evaluating the impact of the settlement on income taxes; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to the settlement; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nTEXT: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the settlement documents; (ii) evaluating management’s process for determining the impact of the settlement to tax years 2007-2016; and (iii) evaluating management’s assessment of other impacts of the settlement, including the amount of interest owed to the IRS. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the applicable tax laws and judicial doctrines related to the settlement, as well as changes in relevant tax regulations, rulings, and case law.\nTEXT: We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1925.\nTEXT: STATEMENT 1Caterpillar Inc.Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31(Dollars in millions except per share data) 202220212020Sales and revenues: Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation$56,574 $48,188 $39,022 Revenues of Financial Products2,853 2,783 2,726 Total sales and revenues59,427 50,971 41,748 Operating costs: Cost of goods sold41,350 35,513 29,082 Selling, general and administrative expenses5,651 5,365 4,642 Research and development expenses1,814 1,686 1,415 Interest expense of Financial Products565 455 589 Goodwill impairment charge925 — — Other operating (income) expenses1,218 1,074 1,467 Total operating costs51,523 44,093 37,195 Operating profit7,904 6,878 4,553 Interest expense excluding Financial Products443 488 514 Other income (expense)1,291 1,814 (44)Consolidated profit before taxes8,752 8,204 3,995 Provision (benefit) for income taxes2,067 1,742 1,006 Profit of consolidated companies6,685 6,462 2,989 Equity in profit (loss) of unconsolidated affiliated companies19 31 14 Profit of consolidated and affiliated companies6,704 6,493 3,003 Less: Profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(1)4 5 Profit 1 $6,705 $6,489 $2,998 Profit per common share$12.72 $11.93 $5.51 Profit per common share — diluted 2$12.64 $11.83 $5.46 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (millions) - Basic526.9 544.0 544.1 - Diluted 2530.4 548.5 548.6\nTABLE: TABLE: STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.; 2022 2021 2020; Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation $ 56,574 $ 48,188 $ 39,022; Revenues of Financial Products 2,853 2,783 2,726; Total sales and revenues 59,427 50,971 41,748; Cost of goods sold 41,350 35,513 29,082; Selling, general and administrative expenses 5,651 5,365 4,642; Research and development expenses 1,814 1,686 1,415; Interest expense of Financial Products 565 455 589; Goodwill impairment charge 925 — —; Other operating (income) expenses 1,218 1,074 1,467; Total operating costs 51,523 44,093 37,195; Operating profit 7,904 6,878 4,553; Interest expense excluding Financial Products 443 488 514; Other income (expense) 1,291 1,814 (44); Consolidated profit before taxes 8,752 8,204 3,995; Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,067 1,742 1,006; Profit of consolidated companies 6,685 6,462 2,989; Equity in profit (loss) of unconsolidated affiliated companies 19 31 14; Profit of consolidated and affiliated companies 6,704 6,493 3,003; Less: Profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (1) 4 5; Profit 1 $ 6,705 $ 6,489 $ 2,998; Profit per common share $ 12.72 $ 11.93 $ 5.51; Profit per common share — diluted 2 $ 12.64 $ 11.83 $ 5.46; - Basic 526.9 544.0 544.1; - Diluted 2 530.4 548.5 548.6.\n"

Nature of operations\nTEXT: Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\nTEXT: Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) – We define ME&T as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME&T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\nTEXT: Financial Products – We define Financial Products as our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products’ information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\nTEXT: We sell our products primarily under the brands “Caterpillar,” “CAT,” design versions of “CAT” and “Caterpillar,” “EMD,” “FG Wilson,” “MaK,” “MWM,” “Perkins,” “Progress Rail,” “SEM” and “Solar Turbines.”\nTEXT: We conduct operations in our ME&T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers’ service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\nTEXT: We distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 43 located in the United States and 113 located outside the United States, serving 192 countries. We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 88 distributors covering 185 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries. We also sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines under the MaK brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors covering 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.\nTEXT: The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing, insurance and risk management products designed to support sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe, Africa and the Middle East.\nTITLE: B. Basis of presentation\nTEXT: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\nTEXT: Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\nTEXT: We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. For VIEs, we assess whether we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance on the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.\nTEXT: Cat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. Credit risk was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.\nTEXT: We include shipping and handling costs in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financial’s depreciation on equipment leased to others, Insurance Services’ underwriting expenses, (gains) losses on disposal of long-lived assets, long-lived asset impairment charges, legal settlements and accruals, contract termination costs and employee separation charges.\nTEXT: Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 primarily include investments in debt and equity securities, prepaid insurance, contract assets, right of return assets, prepaid and refundable income taxes, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, restricted cash and other short-term investments.\nTEXT: Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation.\nTITLE: C. Inventories\nTEXT: We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We principally determine cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 65 percent and 60 percent of total inventories at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTEXT: If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $3,321 million and $2,599 million higher than reported at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n"

Depreciation and amortization\nTEXT: We compute depreciation of plant and equipment principally using accelerated methods. We compute depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $718 million, $755 million and $758 million, respectively, which we include in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, consolidated depreciation expense was $1,937 million, $2,050 million and $2,122 million, respectively. We compute amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years.\nTITLE: E. Foreign currency translation\nTEXT: The functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products consolidated subsidiaries is the respective local currency. We include gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. We include gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in Statement 3.\nTITLE: F. Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 4 for more information.\nTITLE: G. Income taxes\nTEXT: We determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. We recognize a current liability for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. We adjust deferred taxes for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\nTITLE: H. Goodwill\nTEXT: For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, we reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.\nTEXT: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. We review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we would recognize the difference as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details.\nTITLE: I. Estimates in financial statements\nTEXT: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill impairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.\nTITLE: J.

      "content": "ITEM 8:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\ndealer, recognize, sale, when, product, dealers, core, user, contract, other\n\nTITLE: A. Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation\nTEXT: We recognize sales of ME&T when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product. A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when we ship the product. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.\nTEXT: Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, we inspect, clean and remanufacture used engines and related components (core). In connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users. We recognize revenue pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above. At the time of sale, we recognize the deposit in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and we recognize the core to be returned as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with usable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. We then transfer the returned core asset into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.\nTEXT: We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. Generally, we estimate the cost of these discounts for each product by model by geographic region based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs. We report the cost of these discounts as a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the product sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on units sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, we report the difference as a change in the transaction price.\nTEXT: Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products. We estimate replacement part returns based on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned. We also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts. If actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated, we recognize the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability in Cost of goods sold and Sales, respectively.\nTEXT: Trade receivables represent amounts due from dealers and end users for the sale of our products, and include amounts due from wholesale inventory financing provided by Cat Financial for a dealer's purchase of inventory. See Note 7 for further information. We recognize trade receivables from dealers and end users in Receivables - trade and other and Long-term receivables trade and other in Statement 3. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,551 million, $7,267 million and $6,310 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $506 million, $624 million and $657 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTEXT: Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When we make a sale to a dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. Our allowance for credit losses is not significant for ME&T receivables.\nTEXT: For certain contracts, we invoice for payment when contractual milestones are achieved. We recognize a contract asset when a sale is recognized prior to invoicing. We reduce the contract asset when we invoice for payment and recognize a corresponding trade receivable. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3. Contract assets were $247 million, $187 million and $187 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n"

Contract liabilities were $2,314 million, $1,557 million and $1,526 million as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We reduce the contract liability when we recognize revenue. During 2022, we recognized $902 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2022. During 2021, we recognized $903 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2021.\nTEXT: We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2022, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $12.2 billion, with about one-half of the amount expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following December 31, 2022. We have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.\nTEXT: We exclude sales and other related taxes from the transaction price. We account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred as a fulfillment cost which is included in Cost of goods sold.\nTEXT: We provide a standard manufacturer’s warranty of our products at no additional cost. At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities.\nTEXT: See Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.\nTITLE: B. Revenues of Financial Products\nTEXT: Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. We record finance revenue over the life of the related finance receivables using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. We recognize revenue from rental payments received on operating leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nTEXT: We suspend recognition of finance revenue and operating lease revenue and place the account on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). We resume recognition of revenue, and recognize previously suspended income, when we consider collection of remaining amounts to be probable. We write off interest earned but uncollected prior to the receivables being placed on non-accrual status through Provision for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, we consider it to be uncollectible. See Note 7 for more information.\n"

Stock-based compensation\nTEXT: Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock’s price when the option was granted. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.\nTEXT: Our long-standing practices and policies specify that the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors approve all stock-based compensation awards. The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award. We consistently apply the same terms and conditions to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. We determine the number of stock-based compensation award units included in an individual’s award based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards are granted. In June of 2017, shareholders amended and restated the Plan. The Plan initially provided that up to 38,800,000 Common Shares would be reserved for future issuance under the Plan, subject to adjustment in certain events. Subsequent to the shareholder approval of the amendment and restatement of the Plan, an additional 36,000,000 Common Shares became available for all awards under the Plan.\nTEXT: Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 2,340,887 for 2022, 3,571,503 for 2021 and 5,317,243 for 2020. The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the amended and restated Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan is 74,800,000, of which 31,334,705 shares remained available for issuance as of December 31, 2022.\nTEXT: Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three-year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. PRSU awards generally have a three-year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant.\nTEXT: Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a “Long Service Separation.” Award terms for stock option and RSU grants allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. We recognize compensation expense for eligible employees for the grants over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, we recognized compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\nTEXT: Award terms for PRSU grants allow for continued vesting upon achievement of the performance target specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. We recognize compensation expense for the PRSU grants with respect to employees who have met the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” over the period from the grant date to the end of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, we recognize compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\nTEXT: At grant, option awards have a term life of ten years. For awards granted prior to 2016, if the “Long Service Separation” criteria are met, the vested options have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date. For awards granted beginning in 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date.\nTEXT: Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option grants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock. The risk-free interest rate was based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant. The weighted-average dividend yield was based on historical information. We determine the expected life from the actual historical employee exercise behavior. The following table provides the assumptions used in determining the fair value of the Option awards for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n"

Derivative financial instruments and risk management\nTEXT: Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts and commodity forward and option contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. We present at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on our risk management practices, including our use of financial derivative instruments.\nTEXT: We recognize all derivatives at their fair value in Statement 3. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on Statement 5.\nTEXT: We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\nTEXT: We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\n"

Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of December 31, 2022, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\nTEXT: We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities.\nTITLE: B.Interest rate risk\nTEXT: Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nTEXT: We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products. We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.\n"

The company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) from certain parts transactions. We vigorously contested the IRS's application of the \"substance-over-form\" or \"assignment-of-income\" judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with associated interest of $250 million. The settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and enables us to avoid the costs and burdens of further disputes with the IRS. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years' taxes and related interest, net of tax.\nTEXT: We are subject to the continuous examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns by the IRS, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nTITLE: 7.

Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial's customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 50 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of December 31, 2022.\nTEXT: Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\nTEXT: During the year ended December 31, 2022, Cat Financial's forecasts for the markets in which it operates reflected a continuation of the trend of relatively low unemployment rates and delinquencies. However, high inflation rates and consequent central bank actions are weakening global economic growth. The company believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\nTITLE: Dealer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTEXT: In general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nTITLE: Classes of finance receivables\nTEXT: Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\nTITLE: •North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\nTITLE: •EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nTITLE: •Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\nTITLE: •Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.\nTITLE: •Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.\nTEXT: •Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables originated worldwide related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines and Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.\nTEXT: Receivable balances, including accrued interest, are written off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible (generally upon repossession of the collateral). Generally, the amount of the write-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the amortized cost. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses when received.\nTEXT: An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021CustomerDealerTotalCustomerDealerTotalAllowance for Credit Losses: Beginning balance$251 $82 $333 $431 $44 $475 Write-offs(108)— (108)(256)— (256)Recoveries62 — 62 51 — 51 Provision for credit losses75 (17)58 30 38 68 Other(3)— (3)(5)— (5)Ending balance$277 $65 $342 $251 $82 $333 Finance Receivables$19,772 $1,585 $21,357 $20,135 $1,793 $21,928\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021; Customer Dealer Total Customer Dealer Total; Beginning balance $ 251 $ 82 $ 333 $ 431 $ 44 $ 475; Write-offs (108) — (108) (256) — (256); Recoveries 62 — 62 51 — 51; Provision for credit losses 75 (17) 58 30 38 68; Other (3) — (3) (5) — (5); Ending balance $ 277 $ 65 $ 342 $ 251 $ 82 $ 333; Finance Receivables $ 19,772 $ 1,585 $ 21,357 $ 20,135 $ 1,793 $ 21,928.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)December 31, 2022December 31, 2021\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: December 31, 2022\nTITLE: December 31, 2021\nTITLE: CustomerDealerTotalCustomerDealerTotal\nTITLE: Customer\nTITLE: Dealer\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Customer\nTITLE: Dealer\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Allowance for Credit Losses:\nTITLE: Beginning balance$251 $82 $333 $431 $44 $475\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 251\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 82\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 333\nTITLE: Write-offs(108)— (108)(256)— (256)\nTITLE: (108)\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: (108)\n"

Rail’s product portfolio includes diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated that the fair value of Rail was below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million, resulting in a full impairment of Rail’s goodwill balance as of October 1, 2022. There was a $36 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The valuation of the Rail reporting unit was based on estimates of future cash flows, which assumed a reduced demand forecast, lower margins due to continued inflationary cost pressures, and a discount rate approximately 140 basis points higher than utilized in the prior year valuation.

Plan assets\nTEXT: In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while reducing risk in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 85 percent fixed income and 15 percent equities. We will revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 79 percent fixed income, 12 percent equities, 5 percent real estate and 4 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in non-U.S. securities.\nTEXT: Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70 percent equities and 30 percent fixed income.\nTEXT: We rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\nTEXT: We permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\nTEXT: The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: We determine fair values as follows:\nTEXT: •Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets.\nTEXT: •Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: •Real estate is stated at the fund’s net asset value or at appraised value.\nTEXT: •Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the fund’s net asset value.\nTEXT: The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:\nTEXT: December 31, 2022(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotal Assets at Fair ValueU.S. Pension Equity securities: U.S. equities$1,098 $20 $26 $99 $1,243 Non-U.S. equities948 — 2 — 950 Fixed income securities: U.S. corporate bonds— 5,460 40 37 5,537 Non-U.S. corporate bonds— 1,244 — — 1,244 U.S. government bonds— 2,904 — — 2,904 U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities— 19 — — 19 Non-U.S. government bonds— 118 — — 118 Real estate— — 8 — 8 Cash, short-term instruments and other108 14 2 309 433 Total U.S. pension assets$2,154 $9,779 $78 $445 $12,456\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measured at NAV Total Assets at Fair Value; U.S. equities $ 1,098 $ 20 $ 26 $ 99 $ 1,243; Non-U.S. equities 948 — 2 — 950; U.S. corporate bonds — 5,460 40 37 5,537; Non-U.S. corporate bonds — 1,244 — — 1,244; U.S. government bonds — 2,904 — — 2,904; U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities — 19 — — 19; Non-U.S. government bonds — 118 — — 118; Real estate — — 8 — 8; Cash, short-term instruments and other 108 14 2 309 433; Total U.S. pension assets $ 2,154 $ 9,779 $ 78 $ 445 $ 12,456.\nTITLE: December 31, 2022\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotal Assets at Fair Value\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Measured at NAV\nTITLE: Total Assets at Fair Value\nTITLE: U.S. Pension\nTITLE: U.S. equities$1,098 $20 $26 $99 $1,243\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,098\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 20\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 26\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 99\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,243\nTITLE: Non-U.S. equities948 — 2 — 950\nTITLE: 948\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 950\nTITLE: Fixed income securities:\nTITLE: U.S. corporate bonds— 5,460 40 37 5,537\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 5,460\nTITLE: 40\nTITLE: 37\nTITLE: 5,537\nTITLE: Non-U.S. corporate bonds— 1,244 — — 1,244\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 1,244\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 1,244\nTITLE: U.S. government bonds— 2,904 — — 2,904\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2,904\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2,904\nTITLE: U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities— 19 — — 19\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 19\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 19\nTITLE: Non-U.S. government bonds— 118 — — 118\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 118\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 118\nTITLE: Real estate— — 8 — 8\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 8\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 8\nTITLE: Cash, short-term instruments and other108 14 2 309 433\nTITLE: 108\nTITLE: 14\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: 309\nTITLE: 433\nTITLE: Total U.S. pension assets$2,154 $9,779 $78 $445 $12,456\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,154\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,779\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 78\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 445\nTITLE: $\n"

We valued these instruments using pricing models that, in management’s judgment, reflect the assumptions a market participant would use.\nTITLE: E. Defined contribution plans\nTEXT: We have both U.S. and non-U.S. employee defined contribution plans to help employees save for retirement. Our primary U.S. 401(k) plan allows eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plan on a tax-deferred basis. Employees are eligible for matching contributions equal to 100 percent of employee contributions to the plan up to 6 percent of cash compensation and an annual employer contribution that ranges from 3 to 5 percent of cash compensation (depending on years of service and age).\nTEXT: These 401(k) plans include various investment funds, including a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the ESOP held 12.0 million and 12.4 million shares, respectively. We allocate all of the shares held by the ESOP to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant. Various other U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans generally allow eligible employees to contribute a portion of their cash compensation to the plans, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution to the funds.\nTEXT: Total company costs related to U.S. and non-U.S. defined contribution plans were as follows:\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)202220212020U.S. plans$392 $440 $384 Non-U.S. plans114 114 89 $506 $554 $473\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: U.S. plans — 2022: 392; 2021: 440; 2020: 384\nTABLE_ROW: Non-U.S. plans — 2022: 114; 2021: 114; 2020: 89\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)202220212020U.S. plans$392 $440 $384 Non-U.S. plans114 114 89 $506 $554 $473\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)202220212020\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: U.S. plans$392 $440 $384\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 392\nTITLE: Non-U.S. plans114 114 89\nTITLE: 114\nTITLE: $506 $554 $473\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 506\nTITLE: 13.Short-term borrowings\nTEXT: December 31,(Millions of dollars)20222021Machinery, Energy & Transportation: Notes payable to banks$3 $9 3 9 Financial Products: Notes payable to banks234 213 Commercial paper5,455 4,896 Demand notes265 286 5,954 5,395 Total short-term borrowings$5,957 $5,404\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2022 2021; Notes payable to banks $ 3 $ 9; 3 9; Notes payable to banks 234 213; Commercial paper 5,455 4,896; Demand notes 265 286; 5,954 5,395; Total short-term borrowings $ 5,957 $ 5,404.\nTITLE: December 31,\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20222021\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3\nTITLE: 3 9\nTITLE: 3\nTITLE: Financial Products:\nTITLE: 234\nTITLE: Commercial paper5,455 4,896\nTITLE: 5,455\nTITLE: Demand notes265 286\nTITLE: 265\nTITLE: 5,954 5,395\nTITLE: 5,954\nTITLE: Total short-term borrowings$5,957 $5,404\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5,957\nTEXT: The weighted-average interest rates on short-term borrowings outstanding were:\nTITLE: December 31, 20222021Notes payable to banks11.3 %4.4 %Commercial paper4.2 %0.1 %Demand notes3.4 %0.2 %\nTABLE: TABLE: 2022 2021; Notes payable to banks 11.3 % 4.4 %; Commercial paper 4.2 % 0.1 %; Demand notes 3.4 % 0.2 %.\nTITLE: December 31, 20222021Notes payable to banks11.3 %4.4 %Commercial paper4.2 %0.1 %Demand notes3.4 %0.2 %\nTITLE: December 31,\nTITLE: 20222021\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 11.3\nTITLE: %\n"

Based on management's allocation decision, which can be revised from time to time, the portion of the Credit Facility available to ME&T as of December 31, 2022 was $2.75 billion. Information on our Credit Facility is as follows:\nTEXT: •In September 2022, we entered into a new 364-day facility. The 364-day facility of $3.15 billion (of which $825 million is available to ME&T) expires in August 2023.\nTEXT: •In September 2022, we amended and restated the three-year facility (as amended and restated, the \"three-year facility\"). The three-year facility of $2.73 billion (of which $715 million is available to ME&T) expires in August 2025.\nTEXT: •In September 2022, we amended and restated the five-year facility (as amended and restated, the \"five-year facility\") The five-year facility of $4.62 billion (of which $1.21 billion is available to ME&T) expires in September 2027.\nTEXT: Other consolidated credit lines with banks as of December 31, 2022 totaled $3.65 billion. These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.\nTEXT: At December 31, 2022, Caterpillar’s consolidated net worth was $15.93 billion, which was above the $9.00 billion required under the Credit Facility. The consolidated net worth is defined as the consolidated shareholders’ equity including preferred stock but excluding the pension and other postretirement benefits balance within AOCI.\nTEXT: At December 31, 2022, Cat Financial’s covenant interest coverage ratio was 2.36 to 1. This was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each calendar quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended, required by the Credit Facility.\nTEXT: In addition, at December 31, 2022, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.05 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.21 to 1. This was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility.\nTEXT: In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial’s other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.

This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\nTITLE: •Level 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nTEXT: •Level 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.\n"

In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3.\nTEXT: We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. We may therefore classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nTEXT: Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\nTEXT: Investments in debt and equity securities\nTEXT: We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: We also have investments in time deposits classified as held-to-maturity debt securities. The fair value of these investments is based upon valuations observed in less active markets than Level 1. These investments have a maturity of less than one year and are recorded at amortized costs, which approximate fair value.\nTEXT: In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\nTEXT: Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate.\nTEXT: See Note 4 for additional information.\nTEXT: Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nTEXT: December 31, 2022(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair ValueAssets Debt securities Government debt securities U.S. treasury bonds$9 $— $— $— $9 Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds— 55 — — 55 Corporate debt securities Corporate bonds and other debt securities— 2,416 50 — 2,466 Asset-backed securities— 182 — — 182 Mortgage-backed debt securities U.S. governmental agency— 333 — — 333 Residential— 2 — — 2 Commercial— 117 — — 117 Total debt securities9 3,105 50 — 3,164 Equity securities Large capitalization value203 — — — 203 Smaller company growth31 — — — 31 REIT— — — 207 207 Total equity securities234 — — 207 441 Derivative financial instruments - assetsForeign currency contracts - net— 328 — — 328 Commodity contracts - net— 15 — — 15 Total assets$243 $3,448 $50 $207 $3,948 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - liabilitiesInterest rate contracts - net— 195 — — 195 Total liabilities$— $195 $— $— $195\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measured at NAV TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value; U.S. treasury bonds $ 9 $ — $ — $ — $ 9; Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds — 55 — — 55; Corporate bonds and other debt securities — 2,416 50 — 2,466; Asset-backed securities — 182 — — 182; U.S. governmental agency — 333 — — 333; Residential — 2 — — 2; Commercial — 117 — — 117; Total debt securities 9 3,105 50 — 3,164; Large capitalization value 203 — — — 203; Smaller company growth 31 — — — 31; REIT — — — 207 207; Total equity securities 234 — — 207 441; Foreign currency contracts - net — 328 — — 328; Commodity contracts - net — 15 — — 15; Total assets $ 243 $ 3,448 $ 50 $ 207 $ 3,948; Interest rate contracts - net — 195 — — 195; Total liabilities $ — $ 195 $ — $ — $ 195.\nTITLE: December 31, 2022\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Measured at NAV\nTITLE: TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\nTITLE: Assets\nTITLE: U.S. treasury bonds$9 $— $— $— $9\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9\nTITLE: Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds— 55 — — 55\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 55\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 55\nTITLE: Corporate debt securities\nTITLE: Corporate bonds and other debt securities— 2,416 50 — 2,466\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2,416\nTITLE: 50\nTITLE: —\n"

A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had loans carried at fair value of $68 million and $100 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n"

Additionally, to a lesser extent, we have a potential credit risk associated with counterparties to derivative contracts.\nTEXT: Trade receivables are primarily short-term receivables from independently owned and operated dealers and customers which arise in the normal course of business. We perform regular credit evaluations of our dealers and customers. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. We do, however, when deemed necessary, make use of various devices such as security agreements and letters of credit to protect our interests. No single dealer or customer represents a significant concentration of credit risk.\nTEXT: Finance receivables and wholesale inventory receivables primarily represent receivables under installment sales contracts, receivables arising from leasing transactions and notes receivable. We typically maintain a security interest in retail financed equipment and, in some instances, wholesale financed equipment. We also typically require physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment. No single customer or dealer represented a significant concentration of credit risk.\nTEXT: Short-term and long-term investments are held with high quality institutions and, by policy, the amount of credit exposure to any one institution is limited. Long-term investments, primarily included in Other assets in Statement 3, are comprised primarily of available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities.\nTEXT: For derivative contracts, collateral is generally not required of the counterparties or of our company. The company generally enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial Products that permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment. The master netting agreements reduce the amount of loss the company would incur should the counterparties fail to meet their obligations. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the maximum exposure to credit loss was $644 million and $342 million, respectively, before the application of any master netting agreements.\nTEXT: Please refer to Note 18 above for fair value information.\nTITLE: 20.Leases\nTITLE: A.

To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option, we have included the option in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

Lessor arrangements\nTEXT: We lease Caterpillar machinery, engines and other equipment to customers and dealers around the world, primarily through Cat Financial. Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease.

Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.\nTEXT: We determine the residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\nTEXT: During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\nTEXT: See Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\nTEXT: The carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\nTEXT: December 31,(Millions of dollars)20222021Equipment leased to others - at original cost$5,568 $5,733 Less: Accumulated depreciation(1,790)(1,870)Equipment leased to others - net$3,778 $3,863\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2022 2021; Equipment leased to others - at original cost $ 5,568 $ 5,733; Less: Accumulated depreciation (1,790) (1,870); Equipment leased to others - net $ 3,778 $ 3,863.\nTITLE: December 31,\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20222021\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: Equipment leased to others - at original cost$5,568 $5,733\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5,568\nTITLE: Less: Accumulated depreciation(1,790)(1,870)\nTITLE: (1,790)\nTITLE: Equipment leased to others - net$3,778 $3,863\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,778\nTEXT: Payments due for operating leases as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotal$801$526$287$129$43$26$1,812\nTABLE: TABLE: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter Total; $801 $526 $287 $129 $43 $26 $1,812.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20232024202520262027ThereafterTotal$801$526$287$129$43$26$1,812\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 20232024202520262027ThereafterTotal\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2026\nTITLE: 2027\nTITLE: Thereafter\nTITLE: Total\nTEXT: Revenues from finance and operating leases, primarily included in Revenues of Financial Products on Statement 1, were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)Year ended December 31202220212020Finance lease revenue$430 $485 $492 Operating lease revenue1,085 1,128 1,124 Total$1,515 $1,613 $1,616\nTABLE: TABLE: 2022 2021 2020; Finance lease revenue $ 430 $ 485 $ 492; Operating lease revenue 1,085 1,128 1,124; Total $ 1,515 $ 1,613 $ 1,616.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Year ended December 31\nTITLE: 202220212020\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: Finance lease revenue$430 $485 $492\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 430\nTITLE: Operating lease revenue1,085 1,128 1,124\nTITLE: 1,085\nTITLE: Total$1,515 $1,613 $1,616\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,515\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,613\nTEXT: We present revenues net of sales and other related taxes.\n"

The bonds have varying terms and are issued to insure governmental agencies against nonperformance by certain dealers. We also provided guarantees to third-parties related to the performance of contractual obligations by certain Caterpillar dealers. These guarantees have varying terms and cover potential financial losses incurred by the third parties resulting from the dealers’ nonperformance.\nTEXT: In 2016, we provided a guarantee to an end user related to the performance of contractual obligations by a Caterpillar dealer. Under the guarantee, which was set to expire in 2025, non-performance by the Caterpillar dealer could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligations by providing goods, services or financial compensation to the end user up to an annual designated cap. This guarantee was terminated during the first quarter of 2022. No payments were made under the guarantee.\nTEXT: Supplier consortium performance guarantee\nTEXT: We provided a guarantee to a customer in Europe related to the performance of contractual obligations by a supplier consortium to which one of our Caterpillar subsidiaries was a member. The guarantee covered potential damages incurred by the customer resulting from the supplier consortium's non-performance. The damages were capped except for failure of the consortium to meet certain obligations outlined in the contract in the normal course of business.

The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the SPC’s assets of $971 million and $888 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $970 million and $888 million, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\nTEXT: Cat Financial has commitments to extend credit to customers and Caterpillar dealers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. Cat Financial applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments to extend credit as we do for other financing. Collateral is not required for these commitments, but if credit is extended, collateral may be required upon funding. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to Caterpillar dealers was $11.31 billion at December 31, 2022. Cat Financial generally has the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms of these dealer commitments at any time. The amount of unused commitments to extend credit to customers was $888 million at December 31, 2022. A portion of these commitments is not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not represent a future cash requirement.\nTEXT: We determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\nTEXT: The reconciliation of the change in our product warranty liability balances for the years ended December 31 was as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)20222021Warranty liability, beginning of period$1,689 $1,612 Reduction in liability (payments)(778)(854)Increase in liability (new warranties)850 931 Warranty liability, end of period$1,761 $1,689\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Warranty liability, beginning of period — 2022: 1,689; 2021: 1,612\nTABLE_ROW: Reduction in liability (payments) — 2022: (778); 2021: (854)\nTABLE_ROW: Increase in liability (new warranties) — 2022: 850; 2021: 931\nTABLE_ROW: Warranty liability, end of period — 2022: 1,761; 2021: 1,689\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20222021\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: Warranty liability, beginning of period$1,689 $1,612\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,689\nTITLE: Reduction in liability (payments)(778)(854)\nTITLE: (778)\nTITLE: Increase in liability (new warranties)850 931\nTITLE: 850\nTITLE: Warranty liability, end of period$1,761 $1,689\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,761\n"

Environmental and legal matters\nTEXT: The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\nTEXT: We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\nTEXT: On January 27, 2020, the Brazilian Federal Environmental Agency (“IBAMA”) issued Caterpillar Brasil Ltda a notice of violation regarding allegations around the requirements for use of imported oils at the Piracicaba, Brazil facility. We have instituted processes to address the allegations. While we are still discussing resolution of these allegations with IBAMA, the initial notice from IBAMA included a proposed fine of approximately $300,000. We do not expect this fine or our response to address the allegations to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTEXT: On January 7, 2015, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois issued a grand jury subpoena to the Company and thereafter issued additional subpoenas; these subpoenas sought information regarding, among other things, movements of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, the purchase and resale of replacement parts by Caterpillar Inc. and non-U.S. Caterpillar subsidiaries, and Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) and related structures. On March 2-3, 2017, federal agents executed search and seizure warrants, which concerned both tax and export activities, at three facilities of the Company in the Peoria, Illinois area, including its former corporate headquarters. The Tax Division of the U.S. Department of Justice conducted a review of the grand jury investigation and informed the Company on November 28, 2022 that it does not have a pending criminal tax matter involving the Company. In January 2023, the government began returning to the Company the documents and information seized under the search warrants, which, as noted, related to both tax and export issues, as well as the documents and information the Company produced under the grand jury subpoenas.\nTEXT: In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTITLE: 23.

We generally manage at the corporate level liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances, and we do not include these in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\nTEXT: •We value segment inventories and cost of sales using a current cost methodology.\nTEXT: •We amortize goodwill allocated to segments using a fixed amount based on a 20-year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.\nTEXT: •We generally manage currency exposures for ME&T at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.\nTEXT: •Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We determine ME&T segment profit on a pretax basis and exclude interest expense and most other income/expense items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income/expense items.\nTEXT: Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 118 to 120 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\nTEXT: •Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.\nTEXT: •Restructuring costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments and contract terminations. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. Only certain restructuring costs in 2020 were excluded from segment profit. See Note 25 for more information.\nTEXT: •Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: •Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.

Headquartered near Fort Worth, Texas, SPM Oil & Gas produces a full line of pumps, flow iron, consumable parts, wellhead and pressure control products that are offered via an extensive global network of service centers. This acquisition, included in the Energy & Transportation segment, is consistent with our strategy of providing our customers expanded offerings and services which will now be one of the broadest in the well service industry. The purchase price, net of $22 million of acquired cash, was approximately $359 million.\nTEXT: We financed the transaction with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $520 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included cash of $22 million, receivables of $106 million, inventories of $159 million, leased assets of $105 million, and property, plant, and equipment of $117 million. Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of $23 million included developed technology and trade names and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period of approximately 8 years. Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $192 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included lease liabilities of $105 million and accounts payable of $33 million. Goodwill of $30 million represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.\nTITLE: 25. Restructuring costs\nTEXT: Our accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, we recognize eligible separation costs at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company. For involuntary programs, we recognize eligible costs when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable.\nTEXT: Restructuring costs for 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)202220212020Employee separations 1$77 $92 $271 Contract terminations 11 2 2 Long-lived asset impairments 16 (63)38 Other 2215 59 43 Total restructuring costs$299 $90 $354 1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation, project management and building demolition, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Employee separations 1 — 2022: 77; 2021: 92; 2020: 271\nTABLE_ROW: Contract terminations 1 — 2022: 1; 2021: 2; 2020: 2\nTABLE_ROW: Long-lived asset impairments 1 — 2022: 6; 2021: (63); 2020: 38\nTABLE_ROW: Other 2 — 2022: 215; 2021: 59; 2020: 43\nTABLE_ROW: Total restructuring costs — 2022: 299; 2021: 90; 2020: 354\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)202220212020\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: Employee separations 1$77 $92 $271\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 77\nTITLE: Contract terminations 11 2 2\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: Long-lived asset impairments 16 (63)38\nTITLE: 6\nTITLE: Other 2215 59 43\nTITLE: 215\nTITLE: Total restructuring costs$299 $90 $354\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 299\nTEXT: 1 Recognized in Other operating (income) expenses.\nTEXT: 2 Represents costs related to our restructuring programs, primarily for inventory write-downs, accelerated depreciation, equipment relocation, project management and building demolition, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold.\nTEXT: The restructuring costs in 2022 were primarily related to actions across the company, including $193 million related to the Rail division that was primarily inventory write-downs, and other strategic actions to address a small number of products. The inventory write-downs were included in \"Other\" in the table above. The restructuring costs in 2021 were primarily related to actions across the company including strategic actions to address a small number of products, which were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility that had been closed. The restructuring costs in 2020 were primarily related to various voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs implemented across the company and strategic actions to address a small number of products, which were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility that had been closed. Both the gains in 2021 and 2020 were included in Long-lived asset impairments in the table above.\nTEXT: On February 1, 2023, we closed on the divestiture of our Longwall business. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of approximately $600 million, of which $494 million was related to the release of accumulated foreign currency translation associated with this divestiture. This loss, primarily non-cash, will be included in our first quarter 2023 restructuring costs and is subject to the finalization of post-closing procedures.\nTEXT: In 2022 and 2021, all restructuring costs were excluded from segment profit. In 2020, only certain restructuring costs were excluded from segment profit. Restructuring costs included in segment profit were as follows:\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)2020Construction Industries$13 Resource Industries19 Energy & Transportation55 Financial Products Segment—\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2020; Construction Industries $ 13; Resource Industries 19; Energy & Transportation 55; Financial Products Segment —.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)2020Construction Industries$13 Resource Industries19 Energy & Transportation55 Financial Products Segment—\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)2020\n"
