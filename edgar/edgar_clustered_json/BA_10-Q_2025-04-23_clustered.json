The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.\nTEXT: Trade-in commitment agreements at March 31, 2025, have expiration dates from 2025 through 2032. At March 31, 2025, and December 31, 2024, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,512 and $1,393.

Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3,036 and $2,991 as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nTITLE: Supply Chain Financing Programs\nTEXT: The Company has supply chain financing programs in place under which participating suppliers may elect to obtain payment from an intermediary. The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on invoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within 30 to 90 days but may extend up to 12 months. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, Accounts payable included $2,107 and $2,703 payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in these programs. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing would have a significant impact on our liquidity.\nTITLE: Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts\nTEXT: Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. In March 2025, the U.S. Air Force (USAF) announced that Boeing has been awarded a contract to design, build and deliver the F-47, its next-generation fighter aircraft. We are making certain capital expenditures that have risk for impairment pending completion of the source selection and evaluation review process for the next-generation fighter aircraft.

Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, services and related technologies. Estimating the cost and time for us and our suppliers to complete these contracts is inherently uncertain due to operational and technical complexities. This uncertainty requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future operational and technical performance, and the outcome of customer and/or supplier contractual negotiations. The risk that actual performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those previously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\nTITLE: VC-25B Presidential Aircraft\nTEXT: The Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the USAF's VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $4 billion program to develop and modify two 747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $379. We are continuing to work with the customer to reset the schedule as they adjust requirements. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: KC-46A Tanker\nTEXT: In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver four next-generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized 11 low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 154 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $29 billion as of March 31, 2025. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of the 767 commercial airplane program with the majority of the manufacturing costs being incurred in the 767 factory and the remaining costs being incurred in the military finishing and delivery centers. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A\nTEXT: Tanker program by $2,002. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately $107 of capitalized precontract costs and $183 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: MQ-25\nTEXT: In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of seven aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 in the third quarter of 2018. In the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $657 for two additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $339. We expect the initial EMD units to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. During the first quarter of 2025, we initiated final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options\nTEXT: In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $860 fixed-price contract and includes five aircraft and seven simulators. The production portion of the contract includes production lots for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft and related services that we believe are probable of being exercised. The five EMD aircraft were delivered as of December 31, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing. In January 2025, the USAF announced an updated acquisition approach for the T-7A Red Hawk that allows the Company to provide a production-ready configuration to the customer prior to low-rate initial production, which better supports the operational needs of the customer and reduces future production risk. During 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $1,770. At March 31, 2025, we had approximately $361 of capitalized precontract costs and $783 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for the first 4 production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: Commercial Crew\nTEXT: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station (ISS).

Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.\nTEXT: If a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent repurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.\nTEXT: Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services.

The loss in 2025 was primarily driven by investments held in Unallocated items, eliminations, and other. The income in 2024 was primarily driven by investments held at our BDS segment.\nTITLE: Backlog\nTEXT: Our total backlog includes contracts that we and our customers are committed to perform. The value in backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue, primarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable revenue recognition model.\nTEXT: Our backlog at March 31, 2025 was $544,736. We expect approximately 24% to be converted to revenue through 2026 and approximately 71% through 2029, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue. We may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations due to various factors including delivery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nTITLE: Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other\nTEXT: Unallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business operations and eliminations of certain sales between segments.

Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constituted the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that was required to be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators returned their fleets to service in the first quarter of 2024. All 737-9 aircraft in production are undergoing this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.\nTEXT: As a result of the accident, the FAA performed an investigation into the 737 quality control system. In the second quarter of 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified. As part of our plan to improve quality and safety and to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. We also began taking additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture.\nTEXT: The 737-9 door plug accident and the resulting actions to improve compliance with our manufacturing quality control requirements have significantly impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTEXT: On November 4, 2024, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) voted to ratify a new contract, thereby ending the work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, which paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon).

This bill has been deemed to be a full-year appropriations bill in respect to satisfying the requirements of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, avoiding a sequester of defense and non-defense spending in fiscal year 2025 (FY25).\nTEXT: The U.S. government could experience a disruption to its operations and/or payments in 2025 if the debt limit is not addressed before the U.S. Treasury exhausts extraordinary measures. These potential disruptions, and any broader macroeconomic impacts, could affect our current programs and contracts and have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nTEXT: Global Trade The global trade landscape is currently highly volatile. Various countries have announced plans for and/or have already implemented new or modified tariffs. For example, in the first quarter of 2025, the United States imposed modified tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, as well as additional tariffs on goods from China. In addition, the United States imposed tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico that are not compliant with the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). We believe that the majority of our imports from Canada and Mexico are compliant with the provisions of the USMCA. Our first quarter results reflect our best estimate of the impacts of the tariffs enacted as of March 31, 2025, and certain potential mitigations.\nTEXT: On April 2, 2025, the United States announced broad reciprocal tariffs on imports from all countries, comprising a 10% baseline tariff and higher country-specific tariffs. Other countries, including China, announced retaliatory actions or plans for retaliatory actions. On April 9, 2025, the United States implemented a 90-day pause on the country-specific reciprocal tariffs for all countries except China,\nTEXT: leaving the 10% baseline tariff in place. These tariffs and any retaliatory actions from other countries could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. In April 2025, certain customers in China informed us that they will not accept deliveries. We continually monitor the global trade environment for new and/or changing tariffs, retaliatory actions, trade agreements, export restrictions, sanctions or other restrictions that may impact the Company or our supply chain or customers, and work to mitigate impacts to our business.\nTEXT: The current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship is challenged due to tariffs and other economic and national security concerns.\nTEXT: We seek to comply with all U.S. and other government import requirements, export control restrictions and sanctions. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and trade restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other governments, as well as any responses that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.\nTEXT: Supply Chain We and our suppliers are experiencing inflationary pressures, as well as supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. Our supply chain is also being impacted by the tariffs discussed above. Certain of our suppliers are also experiencing financial difficulties. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. During 2024, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,770 million on the T-7A Red Hawk program that was primarily driven by projected increases in supplier cost estimates. In addition, we recorded losses on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs during 2024 that were partially attributable to higher supplier costs.\nTITLE: Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nTITLE: Commercial Airplanes\nTITLE: Results of Operations\nTEXT: (Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 3120252024Revenues$8,147$4,653Loss from operations($537)($1,143)Operating margins(6.6)%(24.6)%\nTABLE: TABLE: (Dollars in millions) Three months ended March 31; 2025 2024; Revenues $8,147 $4,653; Loss from operations ($537) ($1,143); Operating margins (6.6)% (24.6)%.\nTITLE: (Dollars in millions)Three months ended March 31\nTITLE: Three months ended March 31\nTITLE: 20252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Revenues$8,147$4,653\nTITLE: $8,147\nTITLE: Loss from operations($537)($1,143)\nTITLE: ($537)\nTITLE: Operating margins(6.6)%(24.6)%\nTITLE: (6.6)%\n"

All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date.

As a result of the accident, the FAA investigated the 737 quality control system, including Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit), and increased its oversight of Boeing’s production and quality and safety management systems. The FAA also communicated it will not approve production rate increases beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. In 2024, we submitted a comprehensive safety and quality plan to the FAA to address the issues identified in connection with the FAA's investigation. We also took additional actions to improve safety and quality, which include investing in workforce training, simplifying plans and processes, eliminating defects, and enhancing our safety and quality culture. In 2025, we are continuing to implement these improvements and align our production plans consistent with the comprehensive safety and quality plan.\nTEXT: We are gradually increasing to a production rate of 38 per month aligned with our safety and quality plan. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 25 aircraft for customers in China. We are scheduled to deliver these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear how the trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact deliveries to China.\nTEXT: We are continuing to work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models, which have been delayed, while we work through the engineering solution for the engine anti-ice system. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nTEXT: If we are unable to deliver aircraft and/or increase future production rates, or certify the 737-7 and 737-10 models consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 6 and Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 767 Program The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently targeting a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 767 commercial program by 2027. This program has break-even gross margins.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program extends through year-end 2027. We increased the accounting quantity by 3 units during the three months ended March 31, 2025, because we now expect to produce an additional 3 units in that timeframe. We are currently targeting a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs.\nTEXT: In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. The first phase of flight testing was paused starting in August and resumed in January. We obtained approval from the FAA to begin the next phase of certification flight testing, and we began these activities in March 2025.\nTEXT: We continue to anticipate first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2026 and the 777-8 Freighter to occur in 2028. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\nTEXT: The 777X program had break-even gross margins at March 31, 2025. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to several factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and any change in the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in reach-forward losses in future periods.\nTEXT: 787 Program We are currently at a production rate of approximately 5 aircraft per month. We are continuing to monitor supply chain health and factory performance as we work to increase production rates. As of March 31, 2025, we had approximately 20 aircraft in inventory, including 4 aircraft for customers in China, that were produced prior to 2023 and required rework. In February 2025, we completed the rework of the last aircraft and expect to deliver the majority of these aircraft in 2025. It is currently unclear how trade tensions between the U.S. and China will impact deliveries to China.\nTITLE: Additional Considerations\nTEXT: On June 30, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire Spirit.

The decrease is primarily due to lower volume on P-8, KC-46 Tanker, ground-based missile defense, proprietary, and E-7 programs, as well as the absence of a favorable MQ-25 contract modification that was awarded during the first quarter of 2024. The decrease in revenue was partially offset by $70 million lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments compared to the prior year comparable period.\nTITLE: Earnings From Operations\nTEXT: BDS earnings from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025, was $155 million, compared with $151 million in the same period in 2024. The increase in earnings is primarily due to lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments of $213 million compared to the comparable period in the prior year. The lower net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments were largely offset by lower earnings from equity method investments and lower volume and mix on P-8, F-15, E-7, and ground-based missile defense programs. During the three months ended March 31, 2025, losses incurred on the five major fixed-price development programs totaled $0 million compared to $222 million in the same period in 2024.\nTEXT: See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: BDS earnings from operations includes our share of earnings from equity method investments of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with $75 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nTITLE: Backlog\nTEXT: BDS backlog of $61,567 million at March 31, 2025 compared with $64,023 million as of December 31, 2024, reflects revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods and the timing of awards. In March 2025, the U.S. Air Force announced that Boeing has been awarded a contract to design, build and deliver the F-47, its next-generation fighter aircraft.

Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nTEXT: Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement income. Non-operating pension and postretirement income represents the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nTEXT: The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Earnings/(loss) from operations were benefits of $193 million and $230 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $43 million and $123 million for the three\nTEXT: months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. The lower benefits in 2025 were primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" on page 28 of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Management uses Core operating earnings/(loss), Core operating margins and Core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.\n"
