Effective with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we discontinued reporting streaming membership metrics, including paid net membership additions (losses), paid memberships at end of period, average paying memberships and average monthly revenue per paying membership.\nTEXT: (2) See the “Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information” section below for additional details on our use of constant currency revenue.\nTEXT: Operating margin for the three months ended June 30, 2025 increased by approximately seven percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period. The increase in operating margin was primarily driven by revenue growth outpacing the growth in cost of revenues, as well as by a slower rate of growth in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses relative to revenue growth.\nTEXT: Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2025 increased $978 million as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to a $1,172 million increase in operating income, driven by a $1,520 million increase in revenues and partially offset by a $151 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to the increase in content amortization. The impact of higher operating income was partially offset by a $57 million decrease in foreign exchange gains and losses and a $140 million increase in the provision for income taxes.\nTITLE: Revenues\nTEXT: We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of June 30, 2025, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $34 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $9 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\nTEXT: We also earn revenues from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live experiences and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Three months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2024\nTEXT: Three Months EndedChange June 30,2025June 30,2024Q2'25 vs. Q2'24 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenues$11,079,166 $9,559,310 $1,519,856 16 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months Ended Change; June 30,2025 June 30,2024 Q2'25 vs. Q2'24; Revenues $ 11,079,166 $ 9,559,310 $ 1,519,856 16 %.\nTITLE: Three Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: June 30,2025June 30,2024Q2'25 vs. Q2'24\nTITLE: June 30,2025\nTITLE: June 30,2024\nTITLE: Q2'25 vs. Q2'24\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Six months ended June 30, 2025 as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2024\nTEXT: Six Months EndedChange June 30,2025June 30,2024YTD'25 vs. YTD'24 (in thousands, except percentages)Revenues$21,621,967 $18,929,750 $2,692,217 14 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Six Months Ended Change; June 30,2025 June 30,2024 YTD'25 vs. YTD'24; Revenues $ 21,621,967 $ 18,929,750 $ 2,692,217 14 %.\nTITLE: Six Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Six Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: June 30,2025June 30,2024YTD'25 vs. YTD'24\nTITLE: June 30,2025\nTITLE: June 30,2024\nTITLE: YTD'25 vs. YTD'24\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Revenues for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 increased 16% and 14% as compared to the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to the growth in memberships, higher pricing, and increased advertising revenue, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging.\nTEXT: The following tables summarize revenue by region for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.

If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nTEXT: In September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15 billion, also with no expiration date. Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company repurchased 5,238,736 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $5.2 billion (excluding the 1% excise tax on stock repurchases as a result of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022). As of June 30, 2025, $12.0 billion remains available for repurchases.\nTEXT: Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery, and personnel-related costs. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity. Our other uses of cash include strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases. We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations.

Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, we had $14.5 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in twelve tranches due between 2026 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\nTEXT: We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 55% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2025. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and the Canadian dollar.\nTEXT: Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates and, in particular, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our revenues, on a constant currency basis, would have been approximately $379 million higher for the six months ended June 30, 2025 than our reported revenues of $21,622 million. See Part I, Item 2, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $2,224 million and $1,850 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $195 million and $187 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n"
