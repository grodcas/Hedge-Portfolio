The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.Refer to Corporate results on pages 40-42 for additional information.Lending- and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting: •in CIB, a reduction in client credits applied to deposit-related fees, as well as higher cash management fees in Payments as a result of higher volume, and•in CCB, higher deposit-related fees as a result of new accounts and higher transaction volume.Asset management fees increased driven by net inflows in AWM and, to a lesser extent, in CCB, and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB.Commissions and other fees increased predominantly in CIB and AWM, largely due to higher brokerage commissions and fees on higher volume and, to a lesser extent, higher custody fees as a result of higher client activity and market levels.Investment securities increased, reflecting a net gain as compared with a net loss in the prior year that was associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. The prior year net loss was primarily related to sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries.Mortgage fees and related income: refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income decreased driven by the net impact of:•lower income in CCB, reflecting an increase in amortization related to new account origination costs, as well as lower net interchange income, partially offset by higher annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact of increased debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments, and•higher card revenue in CIB Payments as a result of higher volume.Refer to CIB segment results on pages 27-34 for additional information.\n"

There are three reportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate.The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 18-19 for a definition of managed basis.Description of business segment reporting methodologyResults of the reportable business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.Revenue sharing When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income.As a result of lower average interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year.Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 79-85 for additional information.Capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 47, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.\n"

The Firm periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance.\nTEXT: When business segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nTEXT: Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income.As a result of lower average interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year.Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the transferred risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 79-85 for additional information.Capital allocationThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity on page 47, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results – Description of business segment reporting methodology on pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of those methodologies.\nTEXT: Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and CIO.\nTEXT: The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.

Refer to pages 97–107 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for a further discussion of the Firm’s capital risk management.Basel III OverviewThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets (\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk. Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for calculating Basel III RWA: a standardized approach (“Standardized”), and an advanced approach (“Advanced”). For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. As of September 30, 2025, the Firm’s Standardized risk-based ratios continue to be more binding than the Advanced risk-based ratios.Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm, calculate their SLRs.Refer to page 47 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on SLR.Key Regulatory Developments Enhanced Supervisory Stress Test Transparency and Public Accountability ProposalsIn October 2025, the Federal Reserve issued proposals to enhance the transparency and public accountability of its annual supervisory stress test used to set the Stress Capital Buffer (\"SCB\") for large bank holding companies, including the Firm. The proposals would require the Federal Reserve to publish comprehensive documentation of the supervisory stress test models and annual stress test scenarios for public comment, including the scenarios for the upcoming 2026 stress test. The proposals also introduce an enhanced disclosure process, under which material changes to stress test models and scenarios would be subject to public comment prior to implementation. Based on the Federal Reserve’s analysis, the proposed changes to the stress test models and scenarios are not expected to materially change the SCB for firms, such as JPMorganChase, that are subject to the supervisory stress test.SCB Volatility Reduction ProposalIn April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to the calculation of the SCB for large bank holding companies, including the Firm. The proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using the average of supervisory stress results from the previous two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB. The proposal would also modify the annual effective date of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make targeted changes to reporting requirements to streamline data collection.Enhanced SLR ProposalIn June 2025, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“eSLR”) requirements for Global Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) BHCs and their insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries by revising the current static leverage buffers at the BHC and IDI levels to 50 percent of the parent GSIB’s U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge, which is referred to as the “eSLR buffer.” In addition, the proposal would make corresponding adjustments to the leverage-based total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”) requirements by replacing the current TLAC leverage buffer with the eSLR buffer and replacing the current static leverage-based eligible LTD requirement with a requirement of 2.5% plus the eSLR buffer. Further, the proposal would remove the eSLR threshold for an IDI subsidiary of a U.S. GSIB to be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework and instead apply the eSLR as a capital buffer requirement. Refer to page 100 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for information on the U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge.Refer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for information on other Key Regulatory Developments.\n"

The proposals would require the Federal Reserve to publish comprehensive documentation of the supervisory stress test models and annual stress test scenarios for public comment, including the scenarios for the upcoming 2026 stress test. The proposals also introduce an enhanced disclosure process, under which material changes to stress test models and scenarios would be subject to\nTEXT: public comment prior to implementation. Based on the Federal Reserve’s analysis, the proposed changes to the stress test models and scenarios are not expected to materially change the SCB for firms, such as JPMorganChase, that are subject to the supervisory stress test.SCB Volatility Reduction ProposalIn April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to the calculation of the SCB for large bank holding companies, including the Firm. The proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using the average of supervisory stress results from the previous two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB. The proposal would also modify the annual effective date of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make targeted changes to reporting requirements to streamline data collection.Enhanced SLR ProposalIn June 2025, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“eSLR”) requirements for Global Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) BHCs and their insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries by revising the current static leverage buffers at the BHC and IDI levels to 50 percent of the parent GSIB’s U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge, which is referred to as the “eSLR buffer.” In addition, the proposal would make corresponding adjustments to the leverage-based total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”) requirements by replacing the current TLAC leverage buffer with the eSLR buffer and replacing the current static leverage-based eligible LTD requirement with a requirement of 2.5% plus the eSLR buffer. Further, the proposal would remove the eSLR threshold for an IDI subsidiary of a U.S. GSIB to be considered “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action framework and instead apply the eSLR as a capital buffer requirement.

This includes excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The fair value of these securities was approximately $554 billion and $594 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The decrease compared to December 31, 2024, was driven by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely offset by an increase in unencumbered CIB trading assets.The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each respective period, the amount was comprised of eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of regulatory haircuts, of approximately $956 billion and $834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities with a fair value of approximately $554 billion and $594 billion.The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $444 billion and $413 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased compared to December 31, 2024 predominantly due to a higher amount of commercial loans and mortgages pledged at Federal Reserve Banks and the FHLBs. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.NSFRThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable funding that is sufficient to meet their “required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

The decrease compared to December 31, 2024, was driven by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely offset by an increase in unencumbered CIB trading assets.The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4 trillion of available cash and securities as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity increased compared to December 31, 2024 predominantly due to a higher amount of commercial loans and mortgages pledged at Federal Reserve Banks and the FHLBs. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity.\n"

      "content": "ITEM 2:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nfirm, collateral, credit, risk, derivative, these, clients, receivables, securities, value\n\nTEXT: Lending-related commitments The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments, such as commitments (including revolving credit facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these financial instruments represent the maximum possible credit risk should the clients draw down on these commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is representative of the Firm’s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments.Receivables from customersReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk, the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to collateral maintenance requirements is generally mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of the activity, the fair value of collateral held and the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair value of the collateral declines. Because of these mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses based on the value of the collateral and probability of borrower default. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.Refer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for credit losses.Derivative contractsDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, the Firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative contracts through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically covered by collateral agreements due to their short maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was approximately 85% and 86% at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a further discussion of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement types.The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets was $59.8 billion and $61.0 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result of market movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and the related cash collateral held by the Firm. In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and other cash collateral that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule. In management’s view, the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration other collateral, which generally represents securities that do not qualify as high quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits of these additional collateral amounts for each counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable master netting agreement and limited to the net amount of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does not reduce the receivables balances and is not included in the tables below, it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative transactions.\n"

The Firm's allowance for credit losses generally consists of:•the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated balance sheets,•the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets, and•the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which is reflected in investment securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2025 was $29.1 billion, reflecting a net addition of $2.2 billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included:•$1.2 billion in wholesale, driven by net increases in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios and changes in credit quality of client-specific exposures, partially offset by the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, including improvements in certain macroeconomic variables, and •$1.1 billion in consumer, driven by loan growth in Card Services and the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by reduced borrower uncertainty.As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm further increased the weight placed on the adverse scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm partially reduced the increase in weight implemented in the first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: •a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.9% in the third quarter of 2026, and •a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0% lower than the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2026.The following table presents the Firm’s central case assumptions for the periods presented: Central case assumptions at September 30, 20254Q252Q264Q26U.S. unemployment rate(a)4.5 %4.7 %4.5 %YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)1.0 %1.5 %1.9 %Central case assumptions at December 31, 20242Q254Q252Q26U.S. unemployment rate(a)4.5 %4.3 %4.3 %YoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)2.0 %1.9 %1.8 %(a)Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.(b)The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated as the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from the prior year.

The gains and losses depicted in the chart below do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital rules.\nTEXT: A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nTEXT: For the 12 months ended September 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 171 of the 259 days, and observed 11 VaR backtesting exceptions.

Interest rate risk arises not only from trading activities which are included in VaR, but also from the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which include extension of loans and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the investment securities portfolio, and associated derivative instruments.Refer to the table on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate identifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.Earnings-at-riskOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These simulations primarily include retained and held-for-sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and financing activities, investment securities, long-term debt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as described on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange exposures arising from capital investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for more information.Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a baseline, over the following 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift involving changes to both short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These scenarios consider many different factors, including:•The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline rates.•Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding assumptions about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients and customers in response to instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with underlying contractual rates, the time since origination, and other factors which are updated periodically based on historical experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that require management judgment. The amount of deposits that the Firm holds at any given time may be influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as broader monetary conditions and competition for deposits.•The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in market interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to customer behavior and competition for deposits.The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios, including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts of deposit balances, both of which are especially significant in the case of consumer deposits. The results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s simulation and other factors.The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures of the Firm’s interest rate exposure.

Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant.The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of September 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actual and forecasted actions, which primarily consist of an increase in cash flow hedges of floating rate loans and in investment securities activity, both of which add duration. This was partially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits. Economic value sensitivityIn addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE.Certain assumptions used in the EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates require management’s judgment to ascertain the appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities. The Firm has established policies and control procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods, including any judgments made as part of such methods, are well-controlled, independently reviewed and applied consistently from period to period. The methods used and judgments made reflect, among other factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and the related business and risk management strategies, which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The Firm believes its estimates for determining the carrying value of its assets and liabilities are appropriate. The following is a brief description of the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving significant judgments.Allowance for credit lossesThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The allowance for credit losses generally comprises:•The allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated),•The allowance for lending-related commitments, and•The allowance for credit losses on investment securities.The allowance for credit losses involves significant judgment on a number of matters including development and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts, incorporation of historical loss experience, assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk ratings, valuation of collateral, and the determination of remaining expected life. Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on these judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-77 and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of macroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty variables. The specific variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by portfolio and geography.•Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.•Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S. unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S. interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S. HPI.Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of economic conditions could significantly affect its estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one factor or input might affect the overall allowance for credit losses because management considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all geographies or product types, and changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such that improvement in one factor or input may offset deterioration in others.To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled credit losses determined using its central and relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments. The central and relative adverse scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of those variables over the eight-quarter forecast period.For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 2.6% in the third quarter of 2026.This analysis is not intended to estimate expected future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:•The allowance as of September 30, 2025, reflects credit losses beyond those estimated under the central scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse scenarios.\n"

For instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3, management must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of observability of certain significant inputs requires management to assess relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs including, for example, transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs used.For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3, management judgment must be applied to assess the appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity considerations, unobservable parameters, and for portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of the net open risk position. The judgments made are typically affected by the type of product and its specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity for the product or within the market as a whole. In periods of heightened market volatility and uncertainty judgments are further affected by the wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates, particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation adjustments applied by the Firm.Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with those of other market participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios.The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the determination of fair value. The use of methodologies or assumptions different than those used by the Firm could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for individual financial instruments.Credit card rewards liability The credit card rewards liability was $15.9 billion and $14.4 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
