We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 26 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nTEXT: To varying degrees, our operating businesses have been impacted by government and private sector actions taken to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, as well as by the development of global geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these events on our businesses.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting generated after-tax earnings of $5.4 billion in 2023, losses of $30 million in 2022 and earnings of $870 million in 2021. Earnings in 2023 benefited from relatively low losses from significant catastrophe events during the year and improved underwriting results at GEICO compared to 2022, reflecting the impacts of premium rate increases and lower claims frequencies. Underwriting results in 2022 and 2021 included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Underwriting losses in 2022 also reflected accelerating claims costs at GEICO. Earnings from insurance underwriting increased $60 million in 2022 and $142 million in 2021 from amounts previously reported due to the retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $3.1 billion (47.5%) in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2022 (34.9%) compared to corresponding prior years. These increases were primarily attributable to higher short-term interest rates, which resulted in significant increases in earnings from our short-term investments.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF declined 14.4% in 2023 compared to 2022 and were relatively unchanged in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease in 2023 was primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs. Results in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs compared to 2021.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business declined 40.3% in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings decline in 2023 reflected lower earnings from the U.S. regulated utilities, reflecting increased wildfire loss estimates, as well as lower earnings from other energy businesses and real estate brokerage businesses. The increase in 2022 reflected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax equity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business.\nTEXT: As disclosed in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in PTC from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023 and we began consolidating PTC’s results of operations on February 1, 2023. In 2021 and 2022 and through January 31, 2023, earnings from PTC on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and are included in earnings from non-controlled businesses in the preceding table.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

Earnings in 2023 reflected increases at certain industrial products manufacturers and services businesses and the impact of Alleghany’s non-insurance businesses acquired in 2022, partially offset by lower earnings from several of our other manufacturing businesses, and from certain of our service and retailing businesses. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, we experienced weakening demand in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses, which continued through 2023.\nTEXT: Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 related to our previously held 38.6% interest in PTC through the application of the acquisition accounting method.\nTEXT: Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $200 million in 2023, $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.\nTEXT: The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2023 were a cyclone and floods in New Zealand and a hailstorm in Italy. In 2022, significant events were Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri.\nTEXT: Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $146 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $143 billion as of December 31, 2022. Our periodic underwriting results may also include foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.-based subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nTEXT: We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”) on October 19, 2022. Alleghany conducts property and casualty insurance businesses through RSUI Group Inc. and CapSpecialty, Inc. (“RSUI and CapSpecialty” or “Alleghany Insurance”), and reinsurance businesses through Transatlantic Reinsurance Company and affiliates (“TransRe Group”). Underwriting results of Alleghany Insurance are included in BH Primary and underwriting results of TransRe Group are included in BHRG.\nTEXT: We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (defined as premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except in BHRG’s retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity policies. We normally receive premiums at the contract inception date, which are then available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods, primarily through deferred charge asset amortization and liability discount accretion charges.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

However, average claims severities continued to rise in 2023 due to higher auto repair parts prices, labor costs and medical inflation. Pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected higher claims frequencies and significant increases in average claims severities, primarily due to substantial cost inflation, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and continued through 2022. GEICO sought rate increases in numerous states in 2022 and 2023 in response to accelerating claims costs. GEICO also significantly reduced advertising expenditures in 2022 and 2023, which contributed to reductions of policies-in-force.\nTEXT: Premiums written increased $730 million (1.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher average premiums per auto policy (16.8%) due to rate increases, partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in policies-in-force.

Life and health benefits incurred declined $637 million (13.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to high pandemic-related life claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses from retroactive reinsurance in each period derived from the amortization of deferred charges and the effects of changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also included pre-tax foreign currency exchange losses of $57 million in 2023 and pre-tax gains of $168 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2021. Before foreign currency exchange effects, pre-tax underwriting losses were $1.5 billion in 2023, $836 million in 2022 and $840 million in 2021.\nTEXT: Estimated ultimate claim liabilities increased $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, which net of changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced pre-tax underwriting losses of approximately $650 million. The increase in ultimate liabilities derived from higher asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims estimates. We increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts $86 million in 2022 and reduced estimated ultimate liabilities $974 million in 2021. The reductions in 2021, net of changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million.\nTEXT: Unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $34.6 billion at December 31, 2023, a decline of $768 million since December 31, 2022. Unamortized deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.5 billion at December 31, 2023, a decline of $375 million since December 31, 2022. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.\nTEXT: Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, as well as the level of competition. Beginning in the latter part of 2022, prices for new business declined to unacceptable levels and we have since not written new business.\nTEXT: Our periodic payment annuity contracts produced pre-tax underwriting losses in each period from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted liabilities, which includes liabilities for contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also included pre-tax foreign currency exchange losses of $60 million in 2023, gains of $71 million in 2022 and losses of $18 million in 2021.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $590 million in 2023, $694 million in 2022 and $554 million in 2021. Losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million from the termination of an existing reinsurance contract in which the settlement payable exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities were $15.2 billion at December 31, 2023, including liabilities of $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies. We adopted ASU 2018-12 on January 1, 2023, which requires quarterly adjustments of the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities based upon prevailing interest rates, with the effects of discount rate changes included in other comprehensive income.\nTEXT: Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $233 million in 2023, $467 million in 2022 and $169 million in 2021.

The reduction in 2023 reflected the impact of net dispositions of investments since the end of the third quarter of 2022, partially offset by higher dividend rates on certain of our holdings. The increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to a net increase in equity security investments. Dividend income also included $34 million in 2023, $46 million in 2022 and $121 million in 2021 from BHE preferred stock. Such amounts were deducted from earnings of the BHE segment. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.\nTEXT: Interest and other investment income increased $4.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 and increased $1.1 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The increases were primarily due to increases in interest rates, as well as the inclusion of interest income from Alleghany’s insurance subsidiaries. We continue to hold substantial balances in short-term investments, including U.S. Treasury Bills. We continue to believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.\nTEXT: Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other liabilities due to policyholders, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. The effect of discount rate changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for long-duration insurance contracts are excluded from float, as such amounts are not included in underwriting earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Float was approximately $169 billion at December 31, 2023, $164 billion at December 31, 2022 and $147 billion at December 31, 2021. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2023 and 2021, and the average cost of float was negative in those years.

The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from reduced West Coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the trucking market, which has impacted our domestic intermodal demand. These declines were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume from higher vehicle production.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.7 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.8% from 2022, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.8%. The volume decline was primarily due to lower demand for chemicals, plastics, minerals, paper and lumber, partially offset by increased shipments of steel and aggregates from infrastructure demand.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, attributable to a volume decrease of 2.9%, partially offset by slightly higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains and feedstocks and renewable diesel.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal declined 3.4% to $3.8 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 4.0%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit.

The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.5 percentage points to 68.4% in 2023 versus 2022. Fuel expenses declined $897 million (19.6%) compared to 2022, reflecting lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved efficiency. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $247 million (4.7%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher headcount and wage inflation. Other revenues (expenses), net increased 90% compared to 2022, primarily due to an increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates.\nTEXT: Railroad operating revenues increased 11.9% in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting an 18.9% increase in average revenue per car/unit, including the impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue driven by higher fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes of 5.8%. BNSF’s pre-tax earnings decreased 1.9% in 2022 from 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 were impacted by lower volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs, offset by higher yield and fuel surcharge revenue.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products increased 11.8% in 2022 to $9.2 billion compared to 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 8.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments, resulting from supply chain disruptions and lower West Coast imports during the second half of the year.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.6 billion in 2022, an increase of 5.6% from 2021, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 5.3%. The volume decrease was primarily due to a decrease in petroleum products related to lower demand for shipments of crude by rail and lower building products, steel and taconite shipments, partially offset by increased mineral shipments.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 12.6% to $5.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher revenue per car/unit partially offset by lower volumes of 2.0%. The decrease in volumes was primarily due to lower grain exports and fertilizer shipments, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains, renewable diesel and feedstocks.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal increased 21.7% to $3.9 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to higher average revenue per car/unit. Coal volumes were unchanged compared to 2021.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $16.6 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.9 billion (21.2%) compared to 2021. Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 65.9% in 2022 versus 2021. The operating expense increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expenses. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $557 million (11.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from the ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $1.8 billion (65.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes.

After-tax earnings decreased $1.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected an increase in energy operating expenses, including an increase in estimated pre-tax loss accruals of $1.6 billion, net of expected insurance recoveries, for wildfires in 2020 and in 2022 that arose in Oregon and California (“Wildfires”). See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires. The decline in earnings also reflected higher interest expense and lower electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales). These items were partially offset by increases in interest and other income and lower depreciation and amortization expense.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of $170 million (2.2%) versus 2022. The decline reflected lower volumes and wholesale rates, as well as increased energy costs, partially offset by an increase in retail customer rates in certain territories. Retail customer volumes decreased 0.8% overall (down 0.8% at PacifiCorp and 2.6% at NV Energy and up 1.3% at MEC) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather, partially offset by higher customer usage and an overall increase in the average number of customers.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $39 million (3.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected higher regulated transportation and storage services revenues from certain general rate cases and increased earnings from the acquisition of an additional 50% ownership interest in the Cove Point liquefied natural gas export, import and storage facility on September 1, 2023, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of other energy businesses decreased $332 million (24.5%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline reflected lower earnings at Northern Powergrid due to unfavorable results at a natural gas exploration project, including the write-off of capitalized exploration costs and lower gas production volumes and prices, as well as from higher deferred income tax expense related to the enactment of the Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom. The earnings decline was also attributable to lower earnings from renewable energy and retail services businesses. The decline in renewable energy and retail services earnings was primarily due to lower income tax benefits, higher operating expenses, lower solar and wind generation at owned projects and the impact of unfavorable changes in valuations of derivatives contracts, partially offset by debt extinguishment gains.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $87 million (87.0%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to a 19% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 28% decrease in closed transaction volumes. These declines were attributable to the impact of rising interest rates and lower existing home sales.\nTEXT: Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $27 million in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher interest and other income, partially offset by unfavorable consolidated income tax adjustments, largely state-related, and higher BHE corporate interest expense from an April 2022 debt issuance.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities after-tax earnings increased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected higher electric utility margin and a $157 million increase in production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses and state income taxes. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC and NV Energy, increases in general and plant maintenance costs, incremental depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and an increase in estimated pre-tax loss accruals of $60 million for the Wildfires, net of expected insurance recoveries.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $586 million (8.3%) compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at PacifiCorp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

Revenues for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 were approximately $56.8 billion, a decline of $16.0 billion (22.0%) from 2022. The decline reflected lower fuel prices, as well as lower fuel sales volumes and in-store sales. PTC sold approximately 16.2 billion gallons of diesel fuel, gasoline and other fuel-related products in 2023 compared to 18.4 billion gallons in 2022. The decline in fuel volumes was predominantly in the wholesale fuel and fuel marketing businesses. Cost of sales in 2023 reflected lower fuel costs than in 2022. Depreciation and amortization expense was $832 million in 2023 and $436 million in 2022. The increase was due to the application of acquisition accounting beginning on February 1, 2023. Interest expense increased $213 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher interest rates.\n"

(“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMC International Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturing and service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tank container and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel (“W&W|AFCO”), acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition. Additionally, the Alleghany acquisition included certain other smaller manufacturers that became part of Marmon.\nTEXT: Revenues of the industrial products group in 2023 increased $4.1 billion (13.2%) and pre-tax earnings increased $824 million (16.9%) compared to 2022. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2023 was 16.3%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2022.\nTEXT: PCC’s revenues were $9.3 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.7 billion (22.7%) compared to 2022. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2023 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, while power/energy and general and industrial products also contributed to the overall revenue increase. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products.\nTEXT: PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion in 2023, an increase of 30.0% compared to 2022. The improved results in 2023 reflected increases in sales and improving manufacturing and operating efficiencies in aerospace businesses, partially offset by operating losses in energy products businesses. PCC continues to strive to improve manufacturing efficiencies, maintain safety and prepare for increasing demand for its products. Continued growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace product demand.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 4.0% compared to 2022. The revenue decline was primarily due to a 7.9% decline in volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. The decline in sales volumes in 2023 was attributable to general market weakness and customer efforts to reduce their inventory levels.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2023 were relatively unchanged compared to 2022. Earnings included insurance recoveries of $11 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022 in connection with fires at the Rockton, Illinois facility in 2021 and the Rouen, France facility in 2019. Excluding insurance recoveries, earnings in 2023 were higher due to the favorable impacts of higher selling prices, favorable changes in product mix and lower raw material costs, partially offset by the impact of lower sales volumes, unfavorable foreign currency translation effects and higher operating expenses.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $11.9 billion in 2023, an increase of $1.2 billion (11.6%) compared to 2022. Business acquisitions, including AP Emissions Technologies and three former Alleghany businesses: Kentucky Trailer, Wilbert Funeral Services, Inc. and Wilbert Plastics Services, accounted for substantially all of the comparative increase. In addition, the Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies, Medical, Metal Services and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues in 2023, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Revenues in 2023 of the Electrical group’s building wire business and the Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups were negatively impacted by lower metals prices, while revenues of the Transportation Products group reflected reduced customer demand, which accelerated over the second half of 2023.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 13.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase reflected the favorable impact of business acquisitions of $90 million and losses of approximately $90 million in 2022 from the shutdown of the Rail & Leasing group business in Russia. Earnings from eight of Marmon’s eleven business groups increased in 2023 compared to 2022. The Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups generated higher organic earnings in 2023, which were offset by lower earnings from the Electrical group’s building wire business and from the Metals Services and Medical groups.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

The increase reflected the impact of business acquisitions, organic sales growth in North America and other regions and higher interest income due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower revenues in the Asia-Pacific region, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and the impact of ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily attributable to higher interest income and to a lesser extent increased operating earnings. The impact of the revenue increase was largely offset by higher raw material costs, changes in sales mix and the adverse effects of geopolitical conflicts.

The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of wide-body aircraft were relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, Boeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022.\nTEXT: PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $1.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC’s results in 2022 were negatively affected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by effects of supply constraints for certain raw materials and the effects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 48.6% in 2022 compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 and 2021 included insurance recoveries of $242 million and $55 million, respectively, related to the Rockton and Rouen fires. Earnings in 2022 also included aggregate losses related to the Rockton fire of $36 million compared to aggregate losses and asset impairment charges in 2021 of $257 million related to the Rockton fire and an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, which caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced lost sales and incremental operating costs.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These increases generally reflected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store shelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and infrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, utility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank car sales.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.1% in 2023 and 16.6% in 2022. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment and strong residential and commercial construction markets. The effects of significant increases in home mortgage interest rates in the U.S. over the past year has slowed demand for our home building businesses and our other building products businesses. Such effects have been partially mitigated by new construction activity, resulting from low supplies of pre-existing homes for sale.\nTEXT: Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $11.4 billion in 2023, a decrease of $1.3 billion (10.3%) compared to 2022. Revenues from home sales decreased $1.6 billion (15.3%) in 2023 to approximately $8.8 billion, primarily due to lower unit sales and changes in product mix. New home unit sales declined 13.7% in 2023, reflecting lower factory-built and site-built homes. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 12.2% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased interest income on higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $23.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2022.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.0 billion in 2023, a decrease of $326 million (13.8%) compared to 2022. Earnings in 2023 reflected lower earnings from the home building businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from financial services. The decline in earnings from the home building businesses reflected the reduction in sales, a lower overall gross sales margin rate and higher operating expenses relative to sales. The increase in financial services earnings was primarily attributable to increased net interest income, partially offset by increased expected loan loss provisions and higher insurance claims.\nTEXT: Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2023, a decrease of 10.0% versus 2022.

Through most of 2023, sales of recreational vehicles declined significantly, attributable in part to the impact of rising interest rates, inflation and other macroeconomic conditions. The decline in recreational vehicle sales was partially offset by increased sales from Forest River’s bus and commercial business.\nTEXT: Revenues of our apparel and footwear businesses declined $452 million (9.4%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The decline was primarily due to reduced apparel revenues, attributable to lower unit volumes, partially offset by higher average selling prices.

Pre-tax earnings in 2023 reflected the impact of the Jazwares acquisition and higher earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses, partially offset by lower earnings from Forest River and Duracell. Certain of our apparel and footwear businesses took actions in 2023 to reduce inventories and right-size operations. The earnings decline at Forest River was primarily due to the impact of lower sales volumes, while the decline at Duracell was primarily attributable to higher restructuring costs.\nTEXT: Consumer products group revenues increased $481 million (3.1%) in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting an 8.0% increase from Forest River and the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, substantially offset by lower apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues (4.7% in the aggregate). In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products group revenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by significant declines in recreational vehicle unit sales. The declines in apparel and footwear revenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of the consumer products group declined $456 million (23.0%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and as a percentage of revenues in 2022 decreased 3.2 percentage points to 9.5%. The earnings decline reflected lower earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River (7.6%).\nTEXT: Our apparel businesses were negatively affected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions in sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 also elevated inventories. We began taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and reduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects.\nTEXT: Earnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to an increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs.

The largest of these businesses are NetJets and FlightSafety (aviation services), which offer shared ownership programs for general aviation aircraft and high technology training products and services to operators of aircraft, and TTI, a distributor of electronics components. Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS-Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various facilities construction management services.\nTEXT: Revenues of the service group increased $1.6 billion (8.3%) in 2023 compared to 2022. IPS produced revenues of $1.3 billion in 2023 and $358 million in 2022. Revenues from aviation services increased 11.5% in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in the number of aircraft in shared aircraft ownership programs and a year-to-date increase in flight hours across NetJets’ various programs, as well as higher average rates.\nTEXT: Revenues from TTI declined 2.7% in 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the effects of business acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 and favorable foreign currency translation effects, revenues declined 5.2% in 2023 versus 2022. TTI experienced significant revenue growth in 2021 and much of 2022. New orders throughout 2023 slowed in several regions, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, attributable to elevated customer inventory levels and increasing price competition. We currently expect these conditions will persist in 2024.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of the service group decreased $52 million (1.7%) in 2023 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 14.5% in 2023, a decrease of 1.5 percentage points compared to 2022. The change in comparative earnings in 2023 reflected lower earnings from TTI and certain of our other service businesses, partially offset by increased earnings from aviation services and the impact of the IPS acquisition. Earnings from TTI declined 17.3%, attributable to reduced sales and gross margin rates and higher operating expenses, partly offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange gains in 2023 compared to losses in 2022. The increase in earnings from aviation services was primarily attributable to a 14.4% increase in average aircraft in the NetJets’ programs and higher rates.\nTEXT: Service group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to revenue increases from TTI and aviation services, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. Revenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter of 2022, new orders began to slow, attributable in part to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected increases in training hours (11%), customer flight hours (9%) and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in flight hours and fuel prices. The impact of these increases were partially offset by changes in sales mix.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of our service group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as well as increased earnings from several of our smaller service businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and lower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings from our smaller service businesses increased $106 million (19.3%) over 2021, reflecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repair services and related products. BHA also offers and insures vehicle service contracts and related insurance products. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings businesses (Nebraska Furniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics.

Retail unit sales increased 2.7%, reflecting an 11.7% increase in new vehicles sold and a 4.7% decrease in pre-owned vehicles sold. Although new vehicle inventory levels remain well below historical levels, vehicle supply continues to gradually rise. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased 6.6% in 2023 versus 2022. Other retailing revenues in the aggregate declined 5.6% in 2023 versus 2022, due primarily to an 8.6% decline in revenues at our home furnishings businesses.\nTEXT: Retailing group pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in 2023, unchanged from 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.7%, primarily due to earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, as well as from higher investment income and lower operating and liability remeasurement expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates peaked in mid-2022 due to supply chain disruptions and have since declined. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $168 million (21.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 28.3% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores.\nTEXT: Retailing group revenues increased $337 million (1.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by combined lower revenues from our other retailers. BHA’s revenues increased 6.1% in 2022 compared to 2021. Revenues from new and used retail vehicle sales increased 5.9% compared to 2021, attributable to higher average vehicle transaction prices, partly offset by a 4.5% decline in total retail units sold. New vehicle unit sales in 2022 were constrained by relatively low, but gradually rising, new vehicle supplies. Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased 11.1% versus 2021. Revenues of the home furnishings group declined 2.6%, while revenues of all other retailers declined 8.9%, primarily due to lower sales at Pampered Chef.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of the retailing group decreased $85 million (4.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021 and the pre-tax margin rate decreased 0.6 percentage points to 8.9%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 18.4%, primarily due to increases in vehicle gross profit margins attributable to low available inventory. BHA’s vehicle gross profit margin rates accelerated during the second half of 2021, peaked in the first half of 2022 and declined over the remainder of the year. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of the retailing group decreased $233 million (23.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to reduced earnings from the home furnishings group, See’s Candies and Pampered Chef.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\n"

After-tax equity earnings attributable to these businesses increased $222 million in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increased earnings from Occidental. We adopted the equity method of accounting for our investment in Occidental common stock on August 4, 2022. Equity method after-tax earnings increased $724 million in 2022 versus 2021, primarily due to higher earnings from Kraft Heinz and PTC and from the inclusion of Occidental in 2022.\nTEXT: Our after-tax earnings from Kraft Heinz were $790 million in 2023, $550 million in 2022 and $317 million in 2021, which included our after-tax share of goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz of $126 million in 2023, $157 million in 2022 and $259 million in 2021. Occidental’s financial information is not available in time for concurrent reporting in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Berkshire’s shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2023 was $561.3 billion, an increase of $87.8 billion since December 31, 2022. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $96.2 billion and included after-tax investment gains of approximately $58.9 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities produced significant volatility in our earnings.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion.

Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.9 in 2024; $1.7 in 2025; $1.5 in 2026; $1.8 in 2027; and $1.9 in 2028.\nTEXT: We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $146 billion at December 31, 2023. We currently forecast claim payments in 2024 of approximately $37 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2024. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events and can be highly uncertain. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2023, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain materials purchase commitments. We currently estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years will approximate $22 billion, including $10 billion in 2024.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2023 follows.\nTITLE: Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses\nTEXT: We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process.\nTEXT: As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims typically have relatively short claim-tails, while casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.\nTEXT: Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2023 were approximately $146 billion, of which 76% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

As of December 31, 2023, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $24.4 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.4 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.\nTEXT: Claim liability estimates for liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2023, case development liabilities averaged approximately 28% of reported reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.\nTEXT: We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.\nTEXT: Our aggregate claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2022 were reduced by $1.5 billion during 2023, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2023 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.\nTEXT: With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2023. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $210 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\nTEXT: BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2023 follows (in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Property Casualty Total; Reported case liabilities $ 8,159 $ 11,455 $ 19,614; IBNR liabilities 9,105 22,769 31,874; Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 17,264 34,224 51,488; Reinsurance recoverable 689 1,481 2,170; Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses $ 16,575 $ 32,743 $ 49,318.\nTITLE: Property Casualty Total\nTITLE: Property\nTITLE: Casualty\nTITLE: Total\nTEXT: Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nTEXT: Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nTEXT: Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverages written under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.\nTEXT: The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary form rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates.\nTEXT: Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further, with some clients reporting annually ranging from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons.\nTEXT: As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nTEXT: Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2023, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $575 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.\nTEXT: Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\nTEXT: Paid and incurred loss development methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.\nTEXT: Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected reporting patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.\nTEXT: Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain property catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.\nTEXT: In 2023, workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $116 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.\nTEXT: For other casualty losses, other than asbestos and environmental, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $225 million in 2023. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios could produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $2 billion, although outcomes of greater than or less than $2 billion are possible.\nTEXT: The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2023. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.\nTEXT: Our retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails will be very long. At December 31, 2023, gross unpaid losses were $34.6 billion and deferred charges were $9.5 billion.\nTEXT: Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnification and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $50 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or mass tort exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our current estimated gross liability.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

We apply judgmental probability factors to these scenarios to determine an expected outcome. We also monitor subsequent loss payment activity and ceding company reports and other available information. We re-estimate ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed.\nTEXT: Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Our estimated liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures were approximately $12.2 billion at December 31, 2023. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed underlying claims data from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we may apply recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.\nTEXT: Deferred charges for retroactive reinsurance contracts, which at contract inception, represents the excess of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. Deferred charges are subsequently charged to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances for the impact of changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2023, we estimate that amortization expense in 2024 will approximate $900 million.\nTEXT: We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, primarily for asbestos, environmental and other casualty exposures. This increase, net of related changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced an incremental pre-tax underwriting loss of approximately $650 million.\nTITLE: Other Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2023 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $84.6 billion and indefinite-lived other intangible assets of $18.9 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods may be used to estimate fair values, including market quotations, multiples of earnings and other valuation techniques. We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTITLE: Other Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, the estimated fair values of nine reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. These reporting units included Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) and three reporting units acquired in late 2022 and early 2023. Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $32.6 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $29.7 billion by 10%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. The three reporting units acquired in late 2022 and early 2023 included PTC, Jazwares and IPS. The fair values of these entities at December 31, 2023 totaled approximately $21.5 billion, which exceeded our carrying values by 1.5%. Goodwill associated with these reporting units was $8.5 billion. The remaining five other reporting units had an aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $4.4 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately 10%. The carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.3 billion.\n"

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nTEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nTEXT: Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nTITLE: Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n"

As of December 31, 2023, goodwill of approximately $8 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $13 billion were recorded at the Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit. PCC primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasted future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates.\nTEXT: Given the significant judgments made by management in their evaluation of potential impairment of PCC goodwill and PCC indefinite-lived intangible assets and the difference between their fair values and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment.

      "content": "ITEM 8:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nother, contracts, assets, value, income, liabilities, financial, when, losses, consolidated\n\nTEXT: (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 26. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain immaterial balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified in prior years to conform to current year presentations.(b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with determinations of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operating businesses have been impacted to varying degrees in recent years by government and private sector actions to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 virus and its variants as well as by the development of geopolitical conflicts, supply chain disruptions and government actions to slow inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.(c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have maturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase.(d)Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in earnings when the securities are sold. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated expected cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e)Investments in equity securities We carry investments in equity securities at fair value and record the changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains and losses. (f)Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by GAAP. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. (g)Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized to investment income as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (g)Loans and finance receivables Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. (h)Other receivables Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premiums receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history. In addition, our credit loss estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge off receivables against the allowances after reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. (i)Derivatives We carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j)Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets when estimating fair value. In such circumstances, alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k)Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2023, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 30% of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2023 and $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (l)Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease We use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions to such property at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 45 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years, independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years, buildings and improvements – 10 to 30 years and machinery, equipment and other – 3 to 10 years. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m)Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.(n)Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the acquisition date values of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (n)Goodwill and other intangible assets Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. (o)Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. We earn premiums, in most cases, ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are normally received in full and are fully earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are fully received and earned at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenues reflect reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenues include certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenues exclude sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenues include consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, relating to certain bridge and structural steel, castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (o)Revenue recognition Utilities and energy revenues derive primarily from regulated electricity and natural gas sales and sales of fuel. Regulated electricity and natural gas revenues are primarily tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Such revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for regulated energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Nonregulated energy revenues include fuel sales, and to a lesser extent, renewable energy and other products. Fuels sold include diesel, gasoline and related products sold on a retail and wholesale basis. Fuel sales are recognized at the point-in-time when the product is delivered, and control is transferred to the customer, and include related excise taxes.Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are completed. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising activities and news distribution.Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases. (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are stated net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge assets. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge assets, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (r)Insurance policy acquisition costs We capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. For short duration property and casualty insurance contracts, we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs over the contract term as the related premiums are earned. For long-duration life and health insurance contracts, we amortize deferred policy acquisition costs at a constant level based on the expected amount of insurance in-force and the expected term of the contract using the assumptions consistent with those used in determining related insurance liabilities. Deferred policy acquisition costs are included in other assets and were approximately $4.6 billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively, related to property and casualty insurance contracts. K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (s)Life, annuity and health insurance benefits Liabilities for life, annuity and health insurance benefits under long-duration insurance contracts represent the present value of expected future cash outflows from future benefit payments and non-acquisition variable expenses, less the present value of expected future “net premiums” which is the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts under GAAP. Such liabilities include the present value of expected future payments based on the discount rates used to measure benefit liabilities and a deferred profit liability, representing the unamortized excess of gross premiums received over the net premiums established at the inception of the contract. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the timing and amount of future claims, premiums and expenses, which require estimates of future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each reporting period based on the prevailing upper-medium grade corporate bond yields (generally single-A rated credit ratings) that reflect the duration characteristics and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities, we generally group contracts by contract issue year. The effects of changes in discount rates are recorded in other comprehensive income.(t)Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u)Foreign currency The accounts of certain subsidiaries are measured using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. (v)Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in U.S. state and local and in foreign jurisdictions. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred income tax assets when realization is not likely. Liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (w)Accounting pronouncement adopted in 2023We adopted Accounting Standards Update 2018-12, “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”), as of January 1, 2023, which modified the accounting, reporting and disclosures related to our long-duration insurance contracts. See Note 1(s). ASU 2018-12 was applied retrospectively as of January 1, 2021 (the “transition date”) to contracts in-force as of the transition date. As of the transition date, the after-tax impact of changes in cash flow assumptions were recorded in retained earnings and the after-tax effect of changes in discount rate assumptions were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. Certain items in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in 2022 and 2021 were revised in connection with the retrospective adoption. The revisions in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the effects of discount rate changes, which were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, and are shown in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity. We also increased previously reported net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders by $142 million in 2021 and $60 million in 2022. We believe such effects are immaterial to our Consolidated Financial statements.A summary of the effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 on selected financial statement line items as of the transition date follows (in millions). Balance at December 31, 2020 Increase (decrease) Balance at January 1, 2021 Life, annuity and health insurance benefits $ 21,616 $ 7,220 $ 28,836 Other policyholder liabilities 8,670 1,697 10,367 Income taxes, principally deferred 74,098 (1,695 ) 72,403 Accumulated other comprehensive income (4,243 ) (5,751 ) (9,994 ) Retained earnings 444,626 (677 ) 443,949 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ equity 443,164 (6,428 ) 436,736 (x) Accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2023 In March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-02, “Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method” (“ASU 2023-02”). ASU 2023-02 permits reporting entities to elect to account for tax equity investments from which the income tax credits are received using the proportional amortization method at the program level if certain conditions are met. Currently, the proportional amortization method is limited to certain affordable housing tax credit investments. ASU 2023-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We believe that the adoption of ASU 2023-02 will not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07, “Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which requires disclosures of significant expenses by segment and interim disclosure of items that were previously required on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is to be applied on a retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-07 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliations and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 requires entities to annually disclose the income tax rate reconciliation using both amounts and percentages, considering several categories of reconciling items, including state and local income taxes, foreign tax effects, tax credits and nontaxable or nondeductible items, among others. Disclosure of the reconciling items is subject to a quantitative threshold and disaggregation by nature and jurisdiction. ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose net income taxes paid or received to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions, as well as by individual jurisdiction, subject to a five percent quantitative threshold. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impact of ASU 2023-09 on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions to such property at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 45 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years, independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years, buildings and improvements – 10 to 30 years and machinery, equipment and other – 3 to 10 years. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.\nTEXT: (l)Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease\nTEXT: Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease\nTEXT: We use property, plant and equipment in our operations.

Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.\n"

Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years, independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years, buildings and improvements – 10 to 30 years and machinery, equipment and other – 3 to 10 years. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life.\nTEXT: We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.\nTEXT: (m)Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.\nTEXT: We are party to contracts where we lease property from others.

We earn premiums, in most cases, ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are normally received in full and are fully earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are fully received and earned at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenues reflect reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenues include certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenues exclude sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenues include consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, relating to certain bridge and structural steel, castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (o)Revenue recognition Utilities and energy revenues derive primarily from regulated electricity and natural gas sales and sales of fuel. Regulated electricity and natural gas revenues are primarily tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Such revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for regulated energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Nonregulated energy revenues include fuel sales, and to a lesser extent, renewable energy and other products. Fuels sold include diesel, gasoline and related products sold on a retail and wholesale basis. Fuel sales are recognized at the point-in-time when the product is delivered, and control is transferred to the customer, and include related excise taxes.Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are completed. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising activities and news distribution.Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract.

Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.\nTEXT: On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“PTC”) for approximately $8.2 billion. The acquisition increased our interest to 80%, representing a controlling interest in PTC for financial reporting purposes as of that date. We began consolidating PTC’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Since PTC’s most significant business activities involve purchasing and selling fuel (energy) on a wholesale and retail basis, and other energy-related businesses, we include PTC within the railroad, utilities and energy sections of our Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Earnings beginning February 1, 2023. We previously owned a 38.6% interest in PTC, which we accounted for under the equity method through the end of January 2023.\nTEXT: PTC operates more than 650 travel center and 75 fuel-only locations across 44 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, as well as large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing businesses in the U.S. PTC also sells diesel fuel at other locations in the U.S. and Canada through various arrangements with third party travel centers and operates a water disposal business in the oil fields sector. PTC’s revenues and net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders for the eleven months ending December 31, 2023 were $51.7 billion and $603 million, respectively. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we remeasured our previously held 38.6% investment in PTC to fair value and recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $3.0 billion, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method. In addition, we valued the noncontrolling interests at fair value as of January 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Pilot Corporation, the holder of the remaining noncontrolling interests in PTC, had an annual option to require us to redeem for cash all or a portion of its interests beginning in 2024. The redemption price was to be based on a multiple of PTC’s earnings for the preceding year, with specified other adjustments, including the amount of PTC’s net debt. Pilot Corporation filed a lawsuit against Berkshire during the fourth quarter of 2023 concerning the application of certain terms underlying the formula for calculating the purchase price to be paid upon exercise of the option. Subsequently, Berkshire filed a counterclaim against Pilot Corporation. All litigation between Pilot Corporation and Berkshire was settled in January 2024, and we acquired Pilot Corporation’s noncontrolling interest in PTC for $2.6 billion, increasing our interest in PTC to 100%.\nTEXT: A summary of the values of PTC’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and redeemable noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 are summarized as follows (in millions).

Prior to the transaction, we also owned 100% of the general partner interests. We previously treated Cove Point as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes because we concluded we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect Cove Point, as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits that could be significant to Cove Point. Accordingly, the interest acquired in the third quarter was an acquisition of a noncontrolling interest.

Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, the measurement of life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes.

See Note 2. 2023 2022 2021 Balance at the beginning of the year: Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses (5,025 ) (2,960 ) (2,912 ) Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 76,942 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 59,244 59,463 52,099 Prior accident years (3,541 ) (2,672 ) (3,116 ) Total 55,703 56,791 48,983 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year (25,184 ) (27,236 ) (22,897 ) Prior accident years (27,065 ) (23,083 ) (18,904 ) Total (52,249 ) (50,319 ) (41,801 ) Foreign currency effect 288 (508 ) (420 ) Net liabilities of acquired businesses — 12,779 — Balance at December 31: Net liabilities 106,189 102,447 83,704 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 4,893 5,025 2,960 Gross liabilities $ 111,082 $ 107,472 $ 86,664 Our claim liabilities under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claim occurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $150 million per event) were approximately $925 million in 2023, $3.1 billion in 2022 ($2.5 billion from Hurricane Ian) and $2.9 billion in 2021 ($1.5 billion from Hurricane Ida). Current accident year incurred losses for private passenger auto insurance declined in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower claims frequencies and higher average claims severities and increased significantly in 2022 versus 2021, attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities. K-92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $3.5 billion in 2023, $2.7 billion in 2022 and $3.1 billion in 2021, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 3.5% in 2023, 3.2% in 2022 and 4.0% in 2021. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses by $2.1 billion in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2022 and $2.4 billion in 2021. The reductions in each year derived from private passenger auto, medical professional liability, and property claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $1.4 billion in 2023, $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021. The reductions in each year reflected reduced estimates from both property and casualty claims. Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental and asbestos exposures, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment, among other factors. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible to arise from these factors. Disaggregated information concerning our claim liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. In this discussion, “claim-tail” refers to the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) to our consolidated claim liabilities as of December 31, 2023 follows (in millions).

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses based on the facts and merits of the claim. Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR claim liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage based on historical data, from which reported claims are deducted to produce the estimated number of unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2023 and are net of estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Claim counts are established when accidents that could result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages and may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all auto policy coverages.

Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2023. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. K-96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Our claim liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, establish additional case liabilities based on our estimates.Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2023. Dollars are in millions.

These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 3.5% in 2023, 3.2% in 2022 and 4.0% in 2021.\nTEXT: We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses by $2.1 billion in 2023, $1.1 billion in 2022 and $2.4 billion in 2021. The reductions in each year derived from private passenger auto, medical professional liability, and property claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $1.4 billion in 2023, $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021. The reductions in each year reflected reduced estimates from both property and casualty claims.\nTEXT: Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental and asbestos exposures, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022.

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.\nTEXT: We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses based on the facts and merits of the claim.\nTEXT: Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR claim liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage based on historical data, from which reported claims are deducted to produce the estimated number of unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.\nTITLE: (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n"

Case loss estimates are reported either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, establish additional case liabilities based on our estimates.\nTEXT: Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.\nTEXT: Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year.

We believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts and that the classification of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value.\nTEXT: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. In 2023, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities under certain contracts by $1.1 billion, which after adjustments to related deferred charge assets, produced an increase in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses of approximately $650 million. The increase derived from higher estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims. Unamortized deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.5 billion at December 31, 2023 and $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022.\nTEXT: In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed.\nTEXT: We monitor evolving case law and its effect on asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Changing laws or government regulations, as well as newly identified toxins and injury events, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. Our estimates of ultimate liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures under our contracts were approximately $12.2 billion at December 31, 2023 and $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022.\nTITLE: (18)Long-duration insurance contracts\n"

During 2023, Berkshire repaid approximately $4.3 billion of maturing senior notes and issued ¥286.4 billion par (approximately $2.05 billion) of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 1.15% and maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2058. Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $2.7 billion at December 31, 2023. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥1,259 billion par at December 31, 2023) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period on our borrowings are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses.

We have settled income tax liabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The 2012 and 2013 tax years are under review by the IRS’s Independent Office of Appeals, and the IRS is currently auditing tax years 2014 through 2019. We are also under audit or subject to audit with respect to income taxes in state and foreign jurisdictions.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2023, were $420 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We do not expect material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2024.\nTEXT: On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 Act”) was signed into law. The 2022 Act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax (“CAMT”) on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 Act are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The extent to which the Company incurs CAMT will depend on the facts and circumstances of the given tax year. We do not expect to incur a CAMT liability in 2023. The Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Treasury may release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the 2022 Act as more guidance becomes available.\nTEXT: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation. As currently designed, Pillar Two will ultimately apply to our worldwide operations. Considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, these rules are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We will continue to monitor U.S. and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential impacts.\nTITLE: (21)Fair value measurements\n"

The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.\nTEXT: Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.\nTEXT: Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector.\nTEXT: Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities.\nTEXT: Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2023 follow (in millions).

These investments are private placements with contractual terms that restrict transfers and currently prevent us from economically hedging our investments. We applied discounted cash flow techniques in valuing the preferred stock and we made assumptions regarding the expected duration of the investment and the effects of subordination in liquidation. In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model. While most of the inputs to the warrant model are observable, we made assumptions regarding the expected duration and volatility.\nTEXT: (22)Common stock The changes in Berkshire’s issued, treasury and outstanding common stock for each of the three years ending December 31, 2023 are shown in the table below.

Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,441,483 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.\nTITLE: (22)Common stock\n"

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets.

Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire’s 92% owned subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Oregon and other Western states. In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to several major wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”), which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. The wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. On July 29, 2022, the 2022 McKinney Fire began in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp’s service territory (the “2022 Wildfire”). Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 Wildfire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities and consumed 60,000 acres in aggregate. The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire, together, are referred to as the “Wildfires”.Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. As of the date of this filing, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims related to the 2020 Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon for which two jury verdicts were issued in June 2023 and January 2024 as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions against PacifiCorp in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims, including through the pursuit of alternative dispute resolution.Numerous lawsuits on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2020 Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint against PacifiCorp that was filed in 2020, captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al., in Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon (the “James case”). The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Amounts sought in the complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximate $8 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are not included in this amount. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Multiple lawsuits have also been filed in California on behalf of plaintiffs related to the 2022 Wildfire. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, non-economic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees, but the amount of damages sought is not specified.K-115 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (27)Contingencies and commitments In June 2023, a jury issued its verdict for the 17 named plaintiffs in the James case finding PacifiCorp liable to the 17 individual plaintiffs and to the class with respect to the four 2020 Wildfires named in the complaint. The jury awarded the 17 named plaintiffs $90 million of damages, including $4 million of economic and property damages, $68 million of non-economic damages and $18 million of punitive damages based on a 0.25 multiplier of the economic and non-economic damages. In September 2023, the Multnomah County Circuit Court ordered trial dates for two consolidated jury trials including approximately 10 class members each and a third trial for certain commercial timber plaintiffs wherein plaintiffs in each of the three damages phase trials will present evidence regarding their damages. The first of these trials addressing nine individual plaintiffs was held in January 2024 while the remaining trials are scheduled at various dates through April 2024. In January 2024, the Multnomah County Circuit Court entered a limited judgment and money award for the June 2023 James case verdict. The limited judgment awards the aforementioned damages, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of any insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. The limited judgment created a lien against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under ORS 82.010, interest at a rate of 9% per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. In January 2024, the jury for the first James damages phase trial awarded nine plaintiffs $62 million of damages, including $6 million of economic damages and $56 million of noneconomic damages. After the January 2024 jury verdict, the Multnomah County Circuit Court doubled the economic damages to $12 million and added $16 million of punitive damages using the 0.25 multiplier determined by the jury for the June 2023 James case verdict. PacifiCorp will request that the Multnomah County Circuit Court judge offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the nine plaintiffs.PacifiCorp has filed its notice of appeal of the jury’s findings and damage awards associated with the June 2023 verdict in the James case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action, and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp’s request to stay the damages phase trials. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s damage awards associated with the January 2024 jury verdict once the judgment is entered. On February 13, 2024, the 17 named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years.A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. Estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires were based on the information available to the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case. Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and non-economic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available. PacifiCorp recorded estimated pre-tax probable Wildfire losses, before expected related insurance recoveries, of approximately $1.9 billion in 2023 and $225 million in 2022. Such amounts, net of expected insurance recoveries, were approximately $1.7 billion in 2023 and $64 million in 2022, which were included in energy operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. PacifiCorp paid $631 million in settlements in 2023 and $53 million in 2022 associated with the 2020 Wildfires. PacifiCorp’s cumulative charges to date for estimated probable Wildfire losses through December 31, 2023, before expected insurance recoveries, were $2.4 billion. It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional Wildfire losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, it is currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details and the ultimate outcome of legal actions. K-116 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (27)Contingencies and commitments HomeServices of America, Inc. (“HomeServices”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is currently defending against eleven antitrust cases, all in federal district courts. In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service (“MLS”) rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS (“Cooperative Compensation Rule”). None of the complaints specify damages sought. However, two cases also allege Texas state law deceptive trade practices claims, for which plaintiffs have provided written notice of the damages sought totaling approximately $9 billion by separate notice as required by Texas law. In one of these cases, Burnett (formerly Sitzer) et al. v. HomeServices of America, Inc. et al., a jury trial commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of $1.8 billion. Federal law authorizes trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury’s findings and damage award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. Based on available information to date, HomeServices believes losses are likely to occur as a result of the jury verdict in the Burnett case and that such damages could be up to $5.4 billion, excluding attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and other costs subject to determination by the court. However, HomeServices is currently unable to reasonably estimate such loss due to, among other reasons, the joint and several nature of the liability and the early stages of the appeals process. It is also reasonably possible that HomeServices will incur losses from the ten other antitrust cases. However, HomeServices is unable to reasonably estimate a specific range of possible losses that could be incurred due to, among other reasons, lack of information about the size of the plaintiff class and potential damages, as well as the joint and several nature of potential liability of the defendants. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that liabilities that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services in the future for use in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2023, estimated future payments under those arrangements over the next five years were as follows: $10 billion in 2024, $4 billion in 2025, $3 billion in 2026, $3 billion in 2027 and $2 billion in 2028.We may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired.\n"

Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages for certain areas and non-economic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available.\nTEXT: PacifiCorp recorded estimated pre-tax probable Wildfire losses, before expected related insurance recoveries, of approximately $1.9 billion in 2023 and $225 million in 2022. Such amounts, net of expected insurance recoveries, were approximately $1.7 billion in 2023 and $64 million in 2022, which were included in energy operating expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. PacifiCorp paid $631 million in settlements in 2023 and $53 million in 2022 associated with the 2020 Wildfires. PacifiCorp’s cumulative charges to date for estimated probable Wildfire losses through December 31, 2023, before expected insurance recoveries, were $2.4 billion.\nTEXT: It is reasonably possible PacifiCorp will incur significant additional Wildfire losses beyond the amounts currently accrued; however, it is currently unable to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses that could be incurred due to the number of properties and parties involved, including claimants in the class to the James case, the variation in those types of properties and lack of available details and the ultimate outcome of legal actions.\nTITLE: (27)Contingencies and commitments\n"

(“HomeServices”), a wholly owned subsidiary of BHE, is currently defending against eleven antitrust cases, all in federal district courts. In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service (“MLS”) rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS (“Cooperative Compensation Rule”). None of the complaints specify damages sought. However, two cases also allege Texas state law deceptive trade practices claims, for which plaintiffs have provided written notice of the damages sought totaling approximately $9 billion by separate notice as required by Texas law.\nTEXT: In one of these cases, Burnett (formerly Sitzer) et al. v. HomeServices of America, Inc. et al., a jury trial commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of $1.8 billion. Federal law authorizes trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury’s findings and damage award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years.\nTEXT: Based on available information to date, HomeServices believes losses are likely to occur as a result of the jury verdict in the Burnett case and that such damages could be up to $5.4 billion, excluding attorneys’ fees, prejudgment interest and other costs subject to determination by the court. However, HomeServices is currently unable to reasonably estimate such loss due to, among other reasons, the joint and several nature of the liability and the early stages of the appeals process.\nTEXT: It is also reasonably possible that HomeServices will incur losses from the ten other antitrust cases. However, HomeServices is unable to reasonably estimate a specific range of possible losses that could be incurred due to, among other reasons, lack of information about the size of the plaintiff class and potential damages, as well as the joint and several nature of potential liability of the defendants.\nTEXT: Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that liabilities that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nTEXT: Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services in the future for use in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2023, estimated future payments under those arrangements over the next five years were as follows: $10 billion in 2024, $4 billion in 2025, $3 billion in 2026, $3 billion in 2027 and $2 billion in 2028.\nTEXT: We may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired.\n"
