The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nTITLE: NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)\nTITLE: NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n"

The lawsuits assert claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures.\nTEXT: Another putative derivative action was filed on October 30, 2023 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned Horanic v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 2023-1096-KSJM). This lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty and insider trading based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief, including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and reform of unspecified corporate governance measures. This derivative matter is stayed pending the final resolution of In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action.\nTITLE: Accounting for Loss Contingencies\nTEXT: As of April 27, 2025, there are no accrued contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while reasonably possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Our Blackwell GPU revenue ramp continued during the quarter, extending beyond large cloud service providers to include consumer internet companies and regional cloud service providers.\nTEXT: On April 9, 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that it requires a license for export to China (including Hong Kong and Macau) and D:5 countries, or to companies headquartered or with an ultimate parent therein, of our H20 integrated circuits and any other circuits achieving the H20’s memory bandwidth, interconnect bandwidth, or combination thereof. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations as the demand for H20 products diminished. The $4.5 billion charge was less than what we initially anticipated as we were able to re-use certain materials. Sales of our H20 products were $4.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 prior to the new export licensing requirements. The H20 export licensing requirements have impacted our current revenue and will also negatively affect our future revenue. We are still evaluating our limited options to supply Data Center compute products compliant with the USG’s export control rules. The export controls applicable to China are complex and address a variety of parameters, including the total processing performance of a chip, the “performance density” of a chip, the interconnect bandwidth of a chip, and the memory bandwidth of a chip. We may be unable to create a competitive product for China’s data center market that receives approval from the USG. In that event, we would effectively be foreclosed from competing in China's data center computing/compute market, with a material and adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTEXT: We believe the China AI market to be a significant opportunity and the existing and new export controls will greatly hinder our ability to address this opportunity and will continue to impact our revenue and operational results.\nTEXT: We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We expect to begin shipping samples and production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our product transitions and sophisticated system configurations may create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality or production issues, increased inventory provisions, warranty costs, or product delays. Customers may postpone purchasing existing products due to frequent new releases or may adopt new technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.\nTEXT: The recent rise of high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is becoming increasingly important across the ecosystem and it is dependent on developer adoption. If the most widely adopted open-source models are developed or deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could significantly weaken the influence of our platform, reduce developer engagement, and limit demand for our products and services. Future demand for our platform will depend on our ability to support, scale, and optimize the next generation of AI models—including open-source large language models—across our full stack of software and hardware offerings.\nTEXT: The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance.\nTEXT: In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” IFR in the Federal Register. After a 120-day delayed compliance period, the IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on all products classified under Export Control Classification Numbers, or ECCNs, 3A090.a, 4A090.a, or corresponding .z ECCNs, including all related software and technology. The licensing requirement would have applied to our most popular data center products, such as our H200 and GB200. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nTEXT: Changes in global trade policies, including the new export controls and tariffs, have increased the complexity and cost of our supply chain and may continue to do so. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.\nTEXT: We plan to increase our U.S.-based manufacturing and invest in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to strengthen our supply chain, boost resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\n"

We have certain customers that may purchase products directly from NVIDIA and may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We also have indirect customers, who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nTEXT: Direct Customers – Sales to one direct customer, Customer A, represented 16% of total revenue and sales to a second direct customer, Customer B, represented 14% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. Sales to two direct customers represented 11% and 13% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nTEXT: Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Actual indirect customer revenue may differ from our estimates. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, two indirect customers which primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors, including through Direct Customers A and B, are estimated to represent 10% or more of total revenue, attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nTEXT: We estimate that in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, an AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue, through one of the above indirect customers and through other indirect customers that provide cloud services.\nTEXT: We have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue.\nTEXT: Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the billing location even if the revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 53% and 48% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nTITLE: Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nTEXT: Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nTEXT: Gross margins decreased to 60.5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 78.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, primarily due to a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations and the initial ramp of more sophisticated systems within Data Center.\nTEXT: Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $5.3 billion, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations, and $393 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $436 million and $114 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. The net effect of provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 11.0% and 1.1% in the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nTITLE: Operating Expenses\nTEXT: Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025Apr 28, 2024$Change%Change ($ in millions)Research and development expenses$3,989 $2,720 $1,269 47 %Sales, general and administrative expenses1,041 777 264 34 %Total operating expenses$5,030 $3,497 $1,533 44 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Apr 27, 2025 Apr 28, 2024 $Change %Change; Research and development expenses $ 3,989 $ 2,720 $ 1,269 47 %; Sales, general and administrative expenses 1,041 777 264 34 %; Total operating expenses $ 5,030 $ 3,497 $ 1,533 44 %.\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Apr 27, 2025Apr 28, 2024$Change%Change\nTITLE: Apr 27, 2025\nTITLE: Apr 28, 2024\nTITLE: $Change\nTITLE: %Change\nTEXT: The increase in research and development expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 was driven by a 34% increase in compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases, a 70% increase in compute and infrastructure, and a 182% increase in engineering development costs for new product introductions.\nTEXT: The increase in sales, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 were primarily driven by compensation and benefits, including stock-based compensation, reflecting employee growth and compensation increases.\nTITLE: Total Other Income (Expense), Net\nTEXT: Three Months Ended Apr 27, 2025Apr 28, 2024$Change ($ in millions)Interest income$515 $359 $156 Interest expense(63)(64)1 Other income (expense), net(180)75 (255)Total other income (expense), net$272 $370 $(98)\nTABLE: TABLE: Apr 27, 2025 Apr 28, 2024 $Change; Interest income $ 515 $ 359 $ 156; Interest expense (63) (64) 1; Other income (expense), net (180) 75 (255); Total other income (expense), net $ 272 $ 370 $ (98).\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Apr 27, 2025Apr 28, 2024$Change\nTITLE: Apr 27, 2025\nTITLE: Apr 28, 2024\n"

Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 14.3% and 13.9% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nTEXT: The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower tax benefit from stock-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in tax benefit from the foreign-derived intangible income deduction.\nTEXT: Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

We continuously evaluate our liquidity and capital resources, including our access to external capital, to ensure we can finance future capital requirements.\nTEXT: Our marketable securities consist of publicly-held equity securities, debt securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies, highly-rated corporations and financial institutions, and foreign government entities, as well as certificates of deposit issued by highly-rated financial institutions. These marketable securities are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.
