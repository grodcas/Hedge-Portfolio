Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, and investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio. They may also include longer-term projects, certain of which we have currently put on hold or slowed the completion of, including a new leading-edge manufacturing facility, a new assembly and test facility, and a new advanced packaging facility, among others.\nTEXT: In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, from which we received $1.1 billion of cash in Q1 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty regarding timing of the US government fulfilling its obligation under our CHIPS Act agreements, and supporting future awards in the US. These government incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities, and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we closed the second phase of our NAND memory business divestiture and received $1.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of certain adjustments. See \"Note 9: Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.\nTEXT: Our total cash and short-term investments and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity, among other factors, for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we amended our 364-day $8.0 billion credit facility agreement to $5.0 billion and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2026. Additionally, we have access to our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which remains available until February 2029. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of March 29, 2025, we had $1.5 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See \"Note 10: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. As part of our ongoing capital management strategy to optimize our debt portfolio and reduce interest expense, we may utilize make-whole provisions, tender offers or open market repurchases to repurchase our debt prior to maturity. In Q1 2025 and Q1 2024, we did not extinguish any debt prior to maturity.\nTEXT: We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country.

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections, we have provided an additional risk factor below regarding uncertainties surrounding international trade policies and the impact they could have on our financial results.\nTEXT: Recently elevated geopolitical tensions, volatility and uncertainty with respect to international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, may have a material adverse impact on our business, the markets in which we compete and the world economy.\nTEXT: In recent months, markets, businesses and consumers have reacted adversely to geopolitical tensions, volatility and uncertainty in international trade policies. Among other things, significant new and expanded tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, and other trade restrictions, have been imposed and modified, and selective tariff exemptions granted, often suddenly and with little notice, impacting a broad range of raw materials and goods, and global trade more generally. In particular, tariffs and other trade restrictions between the US and China have escalated dramatically and included high tariff and reciprocal tariff rates, the imposition of enhanced US export controls on high performance integrated circuits designed to limit access to such semiconductors in China, the imposition by China of tariffs applying to US-origin semiconductors such as those manufactured by us in the US, while exempting semiconductors manufactured outside the US, as is the case with our fabless competitors, and limitations by China on the export of rare earth minerals critical to the functioning of a range of technology products and processes and where China is the primary source of global supply. The US government has signaled it may impose future additional tariffs related to semiconductors. As a US-based semiconductor manufacturer that designs and manufactures a significant portion of our products domestically, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from sales to customers that assemble computer products in Asia for consumption by consumers and businesses globally. In fiscal 2024, consolidated net revenue from sales (based on billing location of the customer) to China and other foreign markets was 29% and 46%, respectively. We have been and may continue to be disadvantaged in or lose access to such international markets as a result of tariffs, export controls, or other trade policies, and the mitigation measures we have taken or may take in the future, including potential re-balancing of our manufacturing between regions, may not be effective or able to be effectuated in a timely manner, or at all. To the extent our customers, including multinational companies, assemble computer products in China and other foreign markets and sell them into the US end market, the imposition of tariffs in the US could adversely affect demand for their computer products, which could in turn adversely affect demand for our semiconductors. Further, our supply chain depends on globally sourced components and raw materials, including various rare earth minerals, that may become difficult or more costly to obtain, which may impair our ability to manufacture our products and increase our costs. We may be unable to fully or even partially pass along any increased costs to our customers, especially where we may be disproportionately impacted as compared to our competitors or where demand for semiconductor products is adversely impacted. The continuation, increase or expansion of tariffs and other trade restrictions, as well as continued or increased geopolitical tensions, volatility and uncertainty with respect to trade and other policies, particularly between the US and China, both directly and through their impacts on business and consumer sentiment and spending, currency exchange and interest rates, debt, equity and commodity prices, inflation, financing markets, international relations, and economic conditions globally, could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operations, financial position, including cash flows and access to financing, cost structure, competitiveness, supply chain logistics, product demand and pricing, and profitability, and may increase the likelihood, or amplify the impacts, of other risks, including those highlighted in the Risk Factors section of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n"

Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. We performed an evaluation of these risks to our financial positions as of December 28, 2024, and updated that analysis as of March 29, 2025, to determine whether material changes in market risks pertaining to currency and interest rates or equity and commodity prices have occurred as a result of the changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls. No material revisions were noted since disclosing \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A, in our 2024 Form 10-K. Risks related to changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, particularly those involving the United States and China are described under “Risk Factors.”\nTEXT: Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nTEXT: Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nTEXT: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nTEXT: Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nTEXT: Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 29, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nTEXT: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTEXT: We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending March 29, 2025. As of March 29, 2025, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.\nTEXT: We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.\nTEXT: Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nTEXT: Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended March 29, 2025, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.\nTEXT: Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nTEXT: Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.\n"
