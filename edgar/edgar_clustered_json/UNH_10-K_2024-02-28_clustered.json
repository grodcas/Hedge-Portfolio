In the United States, health care spending has grown consistently for many years and comprises 18% of gross domestic product (GDP). We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\nTEXT: Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including care patterns, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\nTEXT: The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\nTEXT: Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends.” Our 2024 benefit design approach contemplates these trends.\nTEXT: In Medicaid, we believe the payment rate environment creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\nTEXT: Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs; care activity; and prescription drug costs. During 2023, we observed increased care patterns, primarily related to outpatient procedures for seniors, which we expect will persist throughout 2024, and may continue in future periods. We endeavor to mitigate those increases by engaging physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\nTEXT: Medicaid Redeterminations. The resumption of Medicaid redeterminations have impacted the number of people served through our Medicaid offerings, partially offset by an increase in consumers served through our commercial offerings as we endeavor to ensure that people and families have continued access to care.\nTEXT: Delivery System and Payment Modernization. The health care market continues to change based on demographic shifts, new regulations, political forces and both payer and patient expectations. Health plans and care providers are being called upon to work together to close gaps in care and improve overall care quality and patient experience, improve the health of populations and reduce costs. We are working to accelerate this vision through the innovation and integration of our care delivery models including in-clinic, in-home, behavioral and virtual care, and by using our data and analytics to provide clinicians with the necessary information in order to provide the best possible care in the most cost efficient setting. We continue to see a greater number of people enrolled in fully accountable value-based plans rewarding high-quality, affordable care and fostering collaboration.\nTEXT: This trend is creating needs for health management services which can coordinate care around the primary care physician, including new primary care channels, and for investments in new clinical and administrative information and management systems, which we believe provide growth opportunities for our Optum business platform. A key focus of our future growth is to accelerate the transition from fee-for-service care delivery and payment models to fully accountable value-based care. This transition requires initial costs such as system enhancements, integrated care coordination technology, physician training and clinical engagement. Enhanced clinical engagement is a critical step to improving the health outcomes of the people we serve and should result in lower costs to the overall health system over time.\n"

For additional information regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, see Part I, Item 1 “Business - Government Regulation” and Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\nTEXT: Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices over the years have at times resulted in industry base rates well below industry forward medical trend. For example, the Final Notice for 2024 rates resulted in an industry base rate decrease, as did the January 2024 Advance Notice for 2025 rates, both of which are well short of what is an increasing industry forward medical cost trend, creating continued pressure in the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, will continue to result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\nTEXT: As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\nTEXT: Pending Disposition. On December 22, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell our operations in Brazil to a private investor, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. We completed the disposition on February 6, 2024, and will record a loss of approximately $7 billion in the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the majority of which was due to foreign currency translation losses in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nTITLE: SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE ITEMS\nTEXT: The following represents a summary of select 2023 year-over-year operating comparisons to 2022.\nTEXT: •Consolidated revenues increased by 15%, UnitedHealthcare revenues increased 13% and Optum revenues grew 24%.\nTEXT: •UnitedHealthcare served nearly 1.1 million more people, driven by growth in commercial and senior offerings.\nTEXT: •Earnings from operations increased by 14%, including an increase of 14% at UnitedHealthcare and 13% at Optum.\nTEXT: •Diluted earnings per common share increased 13% to $23.86.\nTEXT: •Cash flows from operations were $29.1 billion.\nTITLE: RESULTS SUMMARY\nTEXT: The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations and other financial information:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change2023202220212023 vs. 2022Revenues:Premiums$290,827 $257,157 $226,233 $33,670 13 %Products42,583 37,424 34,437 5,159 14 Services34,123 27,551 24,603 6,572 24 Investment and other income4,089 2,030 2,324 2,059 101 Total revenues371,622 324,162 287,597 47,460 15 Operating costs:Medical costs241,894 210,842 186,911 31,052 15 Operating costs54,628 47,782 42,579 6,846 14 Cost of products sold38,770 33,703 31,034 5,067 15 Depreciation and amortization3,972 3,400 3,103 572 17 Total operating costs339,264 295,727 263,627 43,537 15 Earnings from operations32,358 28,435 23,970 3,923 14 Interest expense(3,246)(2,092)(1,660)(1,154)55 Earnings before income taxes29,112 26,343 22,310 2,769 11 Provision for income taxes(5,968)(5,704)(4,578)(264)5 Net earnings23,144 20,639 17,732 2,505 12 Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(763)(519)(447)(244)47 Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$22,381 $20,120 $17,285 $2,261 11 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders$23.86 $21.18 $18.08 $2.68 13 %Medical care ratio (a)83.2 %82.0 %82.6 %1.2 %Operating cost ratio14.7 14.7 14.8 — Operating margin8.7 8.8 8.3 (0.1)Tax rate20.5 21.7 20.5 (1.2)Net earnings margin (b)6.0 6.2 6.0 (0.2)Return on equity (c)27.0 %27.2 %25.2 %(0.2)%\nTABLE: TABLE: (in millions, except percentages and per share data) For the Years Ended December 31, Change; 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs. 2022; Premiums $ 290,827 $ 257,157 $ 226,233 $ 33,670 13 %; Products 42,583 37,424 34,437 5,159 14; Services 34,123 27,551 24,603 6,572 24; Investment and other income 4,089 2,030 2,324 2,059 101; Total revenues 371,622 324,162 287,597 47,460 15; Medical costs 241,894 210,842 186,911 31,052 15; Operating costs 54,628 47,782 42,579 6,846 14; Cost of products sold 38,770 33,703 31,034 5,067 15; Depreciation and amortization 3,972 3,400 3,103 572 17; Total operating costs 339,264 295,727 263,627 43,537 15; Earnings from operations 32,358 28,435 23,970 3,923 14; Interest expense (3,246) (2,092) (1,660) (1,154) 55; Earnings before income taxes 29,112 26,343 22,310 2,769 11; Provision for income taxes (5,968) (5,704) (4,578) (264) 5; Net earnings 23,144 20,639 17,732 2,505 12; Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (763) (519) (447) (244) 47; Net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 22,381 $ 20,120 $ 17,285 $ 2,261 11 %; Diluted earnings per share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 23.86 $ 21.18 $ 18.08 $ 2.68 13 %; Medical care ratio (a) 83.2 % 82.0 % 82.6 % 1.2 %; Operating cost ratio 14.7 14.7 14.8 —; Operating margin 8.7 8.8 8.3 (0.1); Tax rate 20.5 21.7 20.5 (1.2); Net earnings margin (b) 6.0 6.2 6.0 (0.2); Return on equity (c) 27.0 % 27.2 % 25.2 % (0.2) %.\nTITLE: (in millions, except percentages and per share data)For the Years Ended December 31,Change\nTITLE: (in millions, except percentages and per share data)\nTITLE: For the Years Ended December 31,\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: 2023202220212023 vs. 2022\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\n"

Cash flows generated from operating activities are principally from earnings before noncash expenses.\nTEXT: Our regulated subsidiaries generate significant cash flows from operations and are subject to, among other things, minimum levels of statutory capital, as defined by their respective jurisdictions, and restrictions on the timing and amount of dividends paid to their parent companies.\nTEXT: Our U.S. regulated subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion and $8.8 billion in 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail concerning our regulated subsidiary dividends.\nTEXT: Our nonregulated businesses also generate significant cash flows from operations available for general corporate use. Cash flows generated by these entities, combined with dividends from our regulated entities and financing through the issuance of long-term debt as well as issuance of commercial paper or the ability to draw under our committed credit facilities, further strengthen our operating and financial flexibility. We use these cash flows to expand our businesses through acquisitions, reinvest in our businesses through capital expenditures, repay debt and return capital to our shareholders through dividends and repurchases of our common stock.\nTEXT: Summary of our Major Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents For the Years Ended December 31,Change(in millions)2023202220212023 vs. 2022Sources of cash:Cash provided by operating activities$29,068 $26,206 $22,343 $2,862 Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments4,280 12,536 2,481 (8,256)Proceeds from common share issuances1,353 1,253 1,355 100 Customer funds administered— 5,548 622 (5,548)Cash received for dispositions685 3,414 15 (2,729)Total sources of cash35,386 48,957 26,816 Uses of cash:Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed(10,136)(21,458)(4,821)11,322 Common share repurchases(8,000)(7,000)(5,000)(1,000)Cash dividends paid(6,761)(5,991)(5,280)(770)Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software(3,386)(2,802)(2,454)(584)Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,777)(6,837)(1,843)5,060 Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests(730)(176)(1,338)(554)Customer funds administered(521)— — (521)Other(2,110)(2,737)(1,564)627 Total uses of cash(33,421)(47,001)(22,300)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents97 34 (62)63 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents$2,062 $1,990 $4,454 $72\nTABLE: TABLE: For the Years Ended December 31, Change; (in millions) 2023 2022 2021 2023 vs. 2022; Cash provided by operating activities $ 29,068 $ 26,206 $ 22,343 $ 2,862; Issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, net of repayments 4,280 12,536 2,481 (8,256); Proceeds from common share issuances 1,353 1,253 1,355 100; Customer funds administered — 5,548 622 (5,548); Cash received for dispositions 685 3,414 15 (2,729); Total sources of cash 35,386 48,957 26,816; Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed (10,136) (21,458) (4,821) 11,322; Common share repurchases (8,000) (7,000) (5,000) (1,000); Cash dividends paid (6,761) (5,991) (5,280) (770); Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software (3,386) (2,802) (2,454) (584); Purchases of investments, net of sales and maturities (1,777) (6,837) (1,843) 5,060; Purchases of redeemable noncontrolling interests (730) (176) (1,338) (554); Customer funds administered (521) — — (521); Other (2,110) (2,737) (1,564) 627; Total uses of cash (33,421) (47,001) (22,300); Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 97 34 (62) 63; Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,062 $ 1,990 $ 4,454 $ 72.\nTITLE: For the Years Ended December 31,Change\nTITLE: For the Years Ended December 31,\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: (in millions)2023202220212023 vs. 2022\nTITLE: (in millions)\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\nTITLE: 2023 vs. 2022\nTEXT: Proceeds from common share issuances\nTEXT: Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash assumed\nTEXT: Purchases of property, equipment and capitalized software\nTEXT: Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nTITLE: 2023 Cash Flows Compared to 2022 Cash Flows\nTEXT: Increased cash flows provided by operating activities were driven by changes in working capital accounts and increased net earnings.

The Company’s cash requirements within the next twelve months include medical costs payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, short-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt, other current liabilities, and purchase commitments and other obligations. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through cash flows from current operations; cash available for general corporate use; and the realization of current assets, such as accounts receivable.\nTEXT: Our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\nTEXT: •Debt obligations. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further detail of our long-term debt and the timing of expected future payments.

However, we also have the ability to generate cash to satisfy both our current and long-term requirements through the issuance of commercial paper, issuance of long-term debt, or drawing under our committed credit facilities or the ability to sell investments. We believe our capital resources are sufficient to meet future, short-term and long-term, liquidity needs.\nTEXT: Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of senior unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes. For more information on our commercial paper and bank credit facilities, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTEXT: Our revolving bank credit facilities contain various covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt to debt-plus-shareholders’ equity ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement.

A significant downgrade in our credit ratings or adverse conditions in the capital markets may increase the cost of borrowing for us or limit our access to capital.\nTEXT: Share Repurchase Program. As of December 31, 2023, we had Board of Directors’ authorization to purchase up to 15 million shares of our common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program. For more information on our share repurchase program, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTEXT: Dividends. In June 2023, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s quarterly cash dividend to shareholders to an annual rate of $7.52 compared to $6.60 per share. For more information on our dividend, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTEXT: Pending Acquisitions. As of December 31, 2023, we have entered into agreements to acquire companies in the health care sector, subject to regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, is approximately $6 billion.\nTEXT: We do not have other significant contractual obligations or commitments requiring cash resources. However, we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, which include internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and may include acquisitions.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nTEXT: Critical accounting estimates are those estimates requiring management to make challenging, subjective or complex judgments, often because they must estimate the effects of matters inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Critical accounting estimates involve judgments and uncertainties which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions.\nTITLE: Medical Costs Payable\nTEXT: Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of our obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received or processed. Depending on the health care professional and type of service, the typical billing lag for services can be up to 90 days from the date of service. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service.\nTEXT: In each reporting period, our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical costs payable estimates associated with previously reported periods. If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is less than the previous estimate, we will decrease reported medical costs in the current period (favorable development). If the revised estimate of prior period medical costs is more than the previous estimate, we will increase reported medical costs in the current period (unfavorable development). Medical costs in 2023, 2022 and 2021 included favorable medical cost development related to prior years of $840 million, $410 million and $1.7 billion, respectively.\nTEXT: In developing our medical costs payable estimates, we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated. For example, for the most recent two months, we estimate claim costs incurred by applying\nTEXT: observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month (PMPM) medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors.\nTEXT: Completion Factors. A completion factor is an actuarial estimate, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by us at the date of estimation. Completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for periods prior to the most recent two months. Completion factors include judgments in relation to claim submissions such as the time from date of service to claim receipt, claim levels and processing cycles, as well as other factors. If actual claims submission rates from providers (which can be influenced by a number of factors, including provider mix and electronic versus manual submissions), actual care activity incurred (which can be influenced by pandemics or seasonal illnesses, such as influenza), or our claim processing patterns are different than estimated, our reserve estimates may be significantly impacted.\nTEXT: The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for those periods as of December 31, 2023: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)(0.75)%$880 (0.50)585 (0.25)292 0.25(290)0.50(579)0.75(867)\nTABLE: TABLE: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable; (0.75)% $ 880; (0.50) 585; (0.25) 292; 0.25 (290); 0.50 (579); 0.75 (867).\nTITLE: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\nTITLE: Completion Factors(Decrease) Increase in Factors\nTITLE: Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\n"

Medical cost PMPM trend factors are significant factors we use in developing our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months. Medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months, provider contracting and expected unit costs, benefit design and a review of a broad set of health care utilization indicators. These factors include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trends, inpatient hospital authorization data and seasonal and other incidence data from the National Centers for Disease Control. We also consider macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, employment and disposable income. A large number of factors can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimates, including: our ability and practices to manage medical and pharmaceutical costs, changes in level and mix of services utilized; mix of benefits offered, including the impact of co-pays and deductibles; changes in medical practices; and catastrophes, epidemics and pandemics.\nTEXT: The following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical costs payable estimates for the most recent two months as of December 31, 2023: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable(in millions)3%$1,128 2752 1376 (1)(376)(2)(752)(3)(1,128)\nTABLE: TABLE: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable; 3% $ 1,128; 2 752; 1 376; (1) (376); (2) (752); (3) (1,128).\nTITLE: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in FactorsIncrease (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\nTITLE: Medical Cost PMPM Quarterly TrendIncrease (Decrease) in Factors\nTITLE: Increase (Decrease)In Medical Costs Payable\nTITLE: (in millions)\nTEXT: The completion factors and medical costs PMPM trend factors analyses above include outcomes considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liabilities for incurred but not reported benefit claims.\nTEXT: Management believes the amount of medical costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claims as of December 31, 2023; however, actual claim payments may differ from established estimates as discussed above. Assuming a hypothetical 1% difference between our December 31, 2023 estimates of medical costs payable and actual medical costs payable, excluding AARP Medicare Supplement Insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebates, 2023 net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately $245 million.\nTEXT: For more detail related to our medical cost estimates, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n"

When testing goodwill for impairment, we may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. During a qualitative analysis, we consider the impact of changes, if any, to the following factors: macroeconomic, industry and market factors; cost factors; changes in overall financial performance; and any other relevant events and uncertainties impacting a reporting unit. If our qualitative assessment indicates a goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform additional quantitative analyses. We may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. For reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, we perform a test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their carrying values, including goodwill. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nTEXT: We estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method which includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. For each reporting unit, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test.\nTEXT: Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. We have not made any adjustments to decrease a discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit. Company-specific adjustments to discount rates are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty. The passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to change in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity analyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates and cash flow projections to analyze the potential for a material impact. As of October 1, 2023, we completed our annual impairment tests for goodwill with all of our reporting units having fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\nTITLE: LEGAL MATTERS\nTEXT: A description of our legal proceedings is presented in Note 12 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nTITLE: CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nTEXT: Investments in financial instruments such as marketable securities and accounts receivable may subject us to concentrations of credit risk. Our investments in marketable securities are managed under an investment policy authorized by our Board of Directors. This policy limits the amounts which may be invested in any one issuer and generally limits our investments to U.S. government and agency securities, state and municipal securities and corporate debt obligations of investment grade. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of employer groups and other customers constituting our client base. As of December 31, 2023, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\n"

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nTEXT: We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 28, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nTITLE: Basis for Opinion\nTEXT: These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nTEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nTITLE: Critical Audit Matter\nTEXT: The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Finance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n"

The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\nTITLE: 2.Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nTITLE: Basis of Presentation, Use of Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies\nTITLE: Basis of Presentation\nTEXT: The Company has prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: These Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\n"

Health care premium payments received from the Company’s customers in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues. Fully insured commercial products of U.S. health plans, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit (Medicare Part D) plans with medical loss ratios (MLRs) as calculated under the definitions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related federal and state regulations and implementing regulation, falling below certain targets are required to rebate ratable portions of their premiums annually. Commercial premiums within the Company’s individual and small group markets are also subject to the ACA risk adjustment program. Medicare Advantage premium revenue includes the impact of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) quality bonuses based on plans’ Star rating. Certain of the Company’s Medicaid business is also subject to state minimum MLR rebates.\nTEXT: Premium revenues are recognized based on the estimated premiums earned, net of projected rebates, because the Company is able to reasonably estimate the ultimate premiums of these contracts. The Company also records premium revenues for certain value-based arrangements at its Optum Health care delivery businesses. Under these value-based arrangements, the Company enters into agreements with health plans to stand ready to deliver, integrate, direct and control certain health care services for patients. In exchange, the Company receives a premium that is typically paid on a per-patient per-month basis. The Company considers these value-based arrangements to represent a single performance obligation where premium revenues are recognized in the period in which health care services are made available.\nTEXT: The Company’s Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D premium revenues are subject to periodic adjustment under CMS’ risk adjustment payment methodology. CMS deploys a risk adjustment model which apportions premiums paid to all health plans according to health severity and certain demographic factors. The CMS risk adjustment model provides higher per member payments for enrollees diagnosed with certain conditions and lower payments for enrollees who are healthier. Under this risk adjustment methodology, CMS calculates the risk adjusted premium payment using diagnosis and encounter data from hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient and physician treatment settings. The Company and health care providers collect, capture and submit the necessary and available data to CMS within prescribed deadlines. The Company estimates risk adjustment premium revenues based upon the data submitted and expected to be submitted to CMS. Risk adjustment data for the Company’s plans are subject to review by the government, including audit by regulators. See Note 12 for additional information regarding these audits.\nTEXT: For the Company’s Optum Rx pharmacy care services business, the majority of revenues are derived from products sold through a contracted network of retail pharmacies or home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacies. Product revenues include the cost of pharmaceuticals (net of rebates), a negotiated dispensing fee and customer co-payments. Pharmacy products are billed to customers based on the number of transactions occurring during the billing period. Product revenues are recognized when the prescriptions are dispensed. The Company has entered into contracts in which it is primarily obligated to pay its network pharmacy providers for benefits provided to their customers regardless of whether the Company is paid. The Company is also involved in establishing the prices charged by retail pharmacies, determining which drugs will be included in formulary listings and selecting which retail pharmacies will be included in the network offered to plan sponsors’ members and accordingly, product revenues are reported on a gross basis.\nTEXT: Services revenue includes a number of services and products sold through Optum. Optum Health’s service revenues include net patient service revenues recorded based upon established billing rates, less allowances for contractual adjustments, and are recognized as services are provided. For its financial services offerings, Optum Health charges fees and earns investment income on managed funds. Optum Insight provides software and information products, advisory consulting arrangements and managed services outsourcing contracts, which may be delivered over several years. Optum Insight revenues are generally recognized over time and measured each period based on the progress to date as services are performed or made available to customers.\n"

Under service fee contracts, the Company receives a monthly fixed fee per employee, which is recognized as revenue as the Company performs, or makes available, the applicable services to the customer. The customers retain the risk of financing health care costs for their employees and employees’ dependents, and the Company administers the payment of customer funds to physicians and other health care professionals from customer-funded bank accounts. As the Company has neither the obligation for funding the health care costs, nor the primary responsibility for providing the medical care, the Company does not recognize premium revenue and medical costs for these contracts in its Consolidated Financial Statements. For these fee-based customer arrangements, the Company provides coordination and facilitation of medical services; transaction processing; customer, consumer and care professional services; and access to contracted networks of physicians, hospitals and other health care professionals. These services are performed throughout the contract period.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, accounts receivables related to products and services were $8.6 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively. In 2023 and 2022, the Company had no material bad-debt expense and there were no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nTEXT: For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, revenue recognized from performance obligations related to prior periods (for example, due to changes in transaction price) was not material.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $11.8 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.\nTEXT: See Note 14 for disaggregation of revenue by segment and type.\nTITLE: Medical Costs and Medical Costs Payable\nTEXT: The Company’s estimate of medical costs payable represents management’s best estimate of its liability for unpaid medical costs as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Each period, the Company re-examines previously established medical costs payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances. As more complete claim information becomes available, the Company adjusts the amount of the estimates and includes the changes in estimates in medical costs in the period in which the change is identified. Approximately 90% of claims related to medical care services are known and settled within 90 days from the date of service and substantially all within twelve months.\nTEXT: Medical costs and medical costs payable include estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services rendered on behalf of consumers, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed, or paid. The Company develops estimates for medical care services incurred but not reported (IBNR), which includes estimates for claims which have not been received or fully processed, using an actuarial process consistently applied, centrally controlled and automated. The actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim processing, seasonal variances in medical care consumption, health care professional contract rate changes, care activity and other medical cost trends, membership volume and\nTEXT: demographics, the introduction of new technologies, benefit plan changes and business mix changes related to products, customers and geography.\nTEXT: In developing its medical costs payable estimates, the Company applies different estimation methods depending on which incurred claims are being estimated. For the most recent two months, the Company estimates claim costs incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month medical costs incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data are available, supplemented by a review of near-term completion factors (actuarial estimates, based upon historical experience and analysis of current trends, of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period adjudicated by the Company at the date of estimation). For months prior to the most recent two months, the Company applies the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated-to-date to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months.\nTITLE: Cost of Products Sold\nTEXT: The Company’s cost of products sold includes the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed to unaffiliated customers either directly at its home delivery, specialty and community pharmacy locations, or indirectly through its nationwide network of participating pharmacies. Rebates attributable to unaffiliated clients are accrued as rebates receivable and a reduction of cost of products sold, with a corresponding payable for the amounts of the rebates to be remitted to those unaffiliated clients in accordance with their contracts and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of product revenue. Cost of products sold also includes the cost of personnel to support the Company’s transaction processing services, system sales, maintenance and professional services.\n"

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates their carrying value because of the short maturity of the instruments. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term. Because of regulatory requirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost. Substantially all other investments are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value based on quoted market prices, where available. Equity investments are measured at fair value, with certain exceptions where the Company has elected to measure investments with unobservable inputs at cost, subject to fair value adjustments upon an impairment or a transaction of the same or similar security. Changes in fair value of equity investments are recognized in net earnings.\nTEXT: The Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities from net earnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of equity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold.\nTEXT: The Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\nTEXT: New information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality.\nTITLE: Assets Under Management\nTEXT: The Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\nTEXT: Pursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.\nTEXT: The effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nTITLE: Other Current Receivables\nTEXT: Other current receivables include amounts due from pharmaceutical manufacturers for rebates and Medicare Part D drug discounts, accrued interest and other miscellaneous amounts due to the Company.\nTEXT: The Company’s pharmacy care services businesses contract with pharmaceutical manufacturers, some of which provide rebates based on use of the manufacturers’ products by its affiliated and unaffiliated clients. The Company accrues rebates as they are earned by its clients on a monthly basis based on the terms of the applicable contracts, historical data and current estimates. The pharmacy care services businesses bill these rebates to the manufacturers on a monthly or quarterly basis depending on the contractual terms and record rebates attributable to affiliated clients as a reduction to medical costs. The Company generally receives rebates two to five months after billing. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, total pharmaceutical manufacturer rebates receivable included in other receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets amounted to $11.0 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively.\nTITLE: Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nTEXT: Prepaid expenses and other current assets included pharmaceutical drug and supplies inventory of $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n"

Capitalized software consists of certain costs incurred in the development of internal-use software, including external direct costs of materials and services and applicable payroll costs of employees devoted to specific software development.\nTEXT: The Company calculates depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

At the lease commencement date, lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term, which includes all fixed obligations arising from the lease contract. If an interest rate is not implicit in a lease, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate for a period closely matching the lease term.\nTEXT: The Company’s ROU assets are included in other assets, and lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities and other liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nTITLE: Goodwill\nTEXT: To determine whether goodwill is impaired, annually or more frequently if needed, the Company performs impairment tests. The Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. When performing quantitative testing, the Company first estimates the fair values of its reporting units using discounted cash flows. To determine fair values, the Company must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow (including significant assumptions about operations, capital levels and income taxes), long-term growth rates for determining terminal value and discount rates. Comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow test. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill.\nTEXT: There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nTITLE: Intangible Assets\nTEXT: The Company’s finite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate an intangible asset (or asset group) may be impaired. The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment annually. There was no impairment of intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nTITLE: Other Current Liabilities\nTEXT: Other current liabilities include health savings account deposits ($13.5 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022), accruals for premium rebates payable, the RSF associated with the AARP Program, the current portion of future policy benefits and customer balances.\nTITLE: Policy Acquisition Costs\nTEXT: The Company’s short duration health insurance contracts typically have a one-year term and may be canceled by the customer with at least 30 days’ notice. Costs related to the acquisition and renewal of short duration customer contracts are primarily charged to expense as incurred.\nTITLE: Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nTEXT: Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the Company’s subsidiaries whose redemption is outside of the Company’s control are classified as temporary equity. These interests primarily relate to put options on unowned shares, which are typically redeemable at fair value after a certain time period. The Company accretes changes in the redemption value to the earliest redemption date utilizing the interest method. If all interests were currently redeemable, the difference between the carrying value and the estimated redemption value is not material.

Restricted shares vest ratably, primarily over four years, and compensation expense related to restricted shares is based on the share price on the date of grant. Stock options vest ratably primarily over four years and may be exercised up to 10 years from the date of grant. Compensation expense related to stock options is based on the fair value at the date of grant, which is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option-pricing model. Under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), eligible employees are allowed to purchase the Company’s stock at a discounted price, which is 90% of the market price of the Company’s common stock at the end of the six-month purchase period. Share-based compensation expense for all programs is recognized in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTITLE: Net Earnings Per Common Share\nTEXT: The Company computes basic earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by dividing net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company determines diluted net earnings per common share attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for potentially dilutive shares associated with stock options, restricted shares and the ESPP (collectively, common stock equivalents), using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes a hypothetical issuance of shares to settle the share-based awards, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. Assumed proceeds include the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the average unrecognized compensation cost. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\nTITLE: 3.

The Company believes it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of December 31, 2023, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was not material.\n"

Fair Value\nTEXT: Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements or have fair values disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets and liabilities are classified into one of three levels of a hierarchy defined by GAAP. In instances in which the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety based on the lowest level input which is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\nTEXT: The fair value hierarchy is summarized as follows:\nTEXT: Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets/liabilities in active markets.\nTEXT: Level 2 — Other observable inputs, either directly or indirectly, including:\nTEXT: •Quoted prices for similar assets/liabilities in active markets;\nTEXT: •Quoted prices for identical or similar assets/liabilities in inactive markets (e.g., few transactions, limited information, noncurrent prices, high variability over time);\nTEXT: •Inputs other than quoted prices observable for the asset/liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, implied volatilities, credit spreads); and\nTEXT: •Inputs corroborated by other observable market data.\nTEXT: Level 3 — Unobservable inputs cannot be corroborated by observable market data.\nTEXT: There were no transfers in or out of Level 3 financial assets or liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2023 or 2022.\nTEXT: Nonfinancial assets and liabilities or financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances, such as when the Company records an impairment. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized $276 million, $211 million and $840 million respectively, of unrealized gains in investment and other income related to fair value adjustments on equity securities primarily in the Company’s venture portfolio, based upon transactions of the same or similar security. There were no other significant fair value adjustments for these assets and liabilities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nTEXT: The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value and determine the fair value hierarchy classification of each class of financial instrument included in the tables below:\nTEXT: Cash and Cash Equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.\nTEXT: Debt and Equity Securities. Fair values of debt securities and equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices, where available. The Company obtains one price for each security primarily from a third-party pricing service (pricing service), which generally uses quoted or other observable inputs for the determination of fair value. The pricing service normally derives the security prices through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, and, if necessary, makes adjustments through the reporting date based upon available observable market information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing service may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates, prepayment speeds and nonbinding broker quotes. As the Company is responsible for the determination of fair value, it performs quarterly analyses on the prices received from the pricing service to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Specifically, the Company compares the prices received from the pricing service to prices reported by a secondary pricing source, such as its custodian, its investment consultant and third-party investment advisors. Additionally, the Company compares changes in the reported market values and returns to relevant market indices to test the reasonableness of the reported prices. The Company’s internal price verification procedures and reviews of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing services have not historically resulted in adjustment to the prices obtained from the pricing service.\nTEXT: Fair values of debt securities which do not trade on a regular basis in active markets but are priced using other observable inputs are classified as Level 2.\nTEXT: Fair value estimates for Level 1 and Level 2 equity securities reported at fair value on a recurring basis are based on quoted market prices for actively traded equity securities and/or other market data for the same or comparable instruments and transactions in establishing the prices.\nTEXT: The fair values of Level 3 investments in corporate bonds, which are not a significant portion of our investments, are estimated using valuation techniques relying heavily on management assumptions and qualitative observations.\nTEXT: Throughout the procedures discussed above in relation to the Company’s processes for validating third-party pricing information, the Company validates the understanding of assumptions and inputs used in security pricing and determines the proper classification in the hierarchy based on such understanding.\n"

In general, the Company is subject to examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years 2015 and forward.\nTITLE: 10. Shareholders' Equity\nTITLE: Regulatory Capital and Dividend Restrictions\nTEXT: The Company’s regulated insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to regulations and standards in their respective jurisdictions. These standards, among other things, require these subsidiaries to maintain specified levels of statutory capital, as defined by each jurisdiction, and restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions which may be paid to their parent companies. In the United States, most of these state regulations and standards are generally consistent with model regulations established by the NAIC. These standards generally permit dividends to be paid from statutory unassigned surplus of the regulated subsidiary and are limited based on the regulated subsidiary’s level of statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus. These dividends are referred to as “ordinary dividends” and generally may be paid without prior regulatory approval. If the dividend, together with other dividends paid within the preceding twelve months, exceeds a specified statutory limit or is paid from sources other than earned surplus, it is generally considered an “extraordinary dividend” and must receive prior regulatory approval.\nTEXT: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.0 billion, including $4.9 billion of extraordinary dividends. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s domestic insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid their parent companies dividends of $8.8 billion, including $7.4 billion of extraordinary dividends.\nTEXT: The Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries had estimated aggregate statutory capital and surplus of $38.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. The estimated statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of the Company's global financially regulated subsidiaries was approximately $18.3 billion as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Optum Bank must meet minimum capital requirements of the FDIC under the capital adequacy rules to which it is subject. At December 31, 2023, the Company believes Optum Bank met the FDIC requirements to be considered “Well Capitalized.”\nTITLE: Share Repurchase Program\nTEXT: Under its Board of Directors’ authorization, the Company maintains a share repurchase program. The objectives of the share repurchase program are to optimize the Company’s capital structure and cost of capital, thereby improving returns to shareholders, as well as to offset the dilutive impact of share-based awards. Repurchases may be made from time to time in open market purchases or other types of transactions (including prepaid or structured share repurchase programs), subject to certain restrictions. In June 2018, the Board of Directors renewed the Company’s share repurchase program with an authorization to repurchase up to 100 million shares of its common stock. The Board of Directors from time to time may further amend the share repurchase program in order to increase the authorized number of shares which may be repurchased under the program.\nTEXT: A summary of common share repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:Years Ended December 31,(in millions, except per share data)20232022Common share repurchases, shares16 14 Common share repurchases, average price per share$493.79 $501.67 Common share repurchases, aggregate cost$8,000 $7,000 Board authorized shares remaining15 31\nTABLE: TABLE: (in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022; Common share repurchases, shares 16 14; Common share repurchases, average price per share $ 493.79 $ 501.67; Common share repurchases, aggregate cost $ 8,000 $ 7,000; Board authorized shares remaining 15 31.\nTITLE: Years Ended December 31,\nTITLE: (in millions, except per share data)20232022\nTITLE: (in millions, except per share data)\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\n"

These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.\nTEXT: The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.\nTITLE: Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews\nTEXT: The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by CMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the IRS, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the FDIC, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments, including South American and other non-U.S. governmental authorities. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.\nTEXT: On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. On February 12, 2018, the court granted in part and denied in part the Company’s motion to dismiss. In May 2018, the DOJ moved to dismiss the Company’s counterclaims, which were filed in March 2018, and moved for partial summary judgment. In March 2019, the court denied the government’s motion for partial summary judgment and dismissed the Company’s counterclaims without prejudice. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.\nTITLE: 13. Business Combinations\nTEXT: During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company completed several business combinations for total consideration of $10.2 billion.\nTEXT: Acquired assets (liabilities) at acquisition date were:(in millions)Cash and cash equivalents$134 Accounts receivable and other current assets660 Property, equipment and other long-term assets634 Other intangible assets2,174 Total identifiable assets acquired3,602 Medical costs payable(1)Accounts payable and other current liabilities(667)Other long-term liabilities(768)Total identifiable liabilities acquired(1,436)Total net identifiable assets2,166 Goodwill10,121 Redeemable noncontrolling interests(122)Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests(1,925)Net assets acquired$10,240\nTABLE: TABLE: Cash and cash equivalents $ 134; Accounts receivable and other current assets 660; Property, equipment and other long-term assets 634; Other intangible assets 2,174; Total identifiable assets acquired 3,602; Medical costs payable (1); Accounts payable and other current liabilities (667); Other long-term liabilities (768); Total identifiable liabilities acquired (1,436); Total net identifiable assets 2,166; Goodwill 10,121; Redeemable noncontrolling interests (122); Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests (1,925); Net assets acquired $ 10,240.\nTITLE: (in millions)\nTEXT: The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent liabilities, are finalized.\nTEXT: The results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in the Company’s consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the acquired entities’ impact on revenues and net earnings was not material.\nTEXT: Unaudited pro forma revenues and net earnings for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as if the business combinations had occurred on January 1, 2022, were immaterial for both periods.\n"

Segment Financial Information\nTEXT: Factors used to determine the Company’s reportable segments include the nature of operating activities, economic characteristics, existence of separate senior management teams and the type of information used by the Company’s chief operating decision maker to evaluate its results of operations. Reportable segments with similar economic characteristics, products and services, customers, distribution methods and operational processes which operate in a similar regulatory environment are combined.\nTEXT: The following is a description of the types of products and services from which each of the Company’s four reportable segments derives its revenues:\nTEXT: •UnitedHealthcare includes the combined results of operations of UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community & State. The U.S. businesses share significant common assets, including a contracted network of physicians, health care professionals, hospitals and other facilities, information technology and consumer engagement infrastructure and other resources. Domestically, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual offers an array of consumer-oriented health benefit plans and services for employers and individuals. Globally, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual provides health and dental benefits and hospital and clinical services to employers and individuals in South America and other diversified global businesses. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement provides health care coverage and health and well-being services to individuals age 50 and older, addressing their unique needs. UnitedHealthcare Community & State provides diversified health care benefits products and services to state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage.\nTEXT: •Optum Health focuses on care delivery, including value-based care; care management; wellness and consumer engagement and health financial services. Optum Health is building a comprehensive, connected health care delivery and engagement platform by directly providing high-quality care, helping people manage chronic and complex health needs, and proactively engaging consumers in managing their health through in-person, in-home, virtual and digital clinical platforms.\nTEXT: •Optum Insight brings together advanced analytics, technology and health care expertise to deliver integrated services and solutions. Hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, life sciences companies and other organizations depend on Optum Insight to help them improve performance, achieve efficiency, reduce costs, meet compliance mandates and modernize their core operating systems to meet the changing needs of the health system.\nTEXT: •Optum Rx offers pharmacy care services and programs, including retail network contracting, home delivery, specialty and community health pharmacy services, infusion, purchasing and clinical capabilities, and develops programs in areas such as step therapy, formulary management, drug adherence and disease and drug therapy management. Optum Rx integrates pharmacy and medical care and is positioned to serve patients with complex clinical needs and consumers looking for a better digital pharmacy experience with transparent pricing.\nTEXT: The Company’s accounting policies for reportable segment operations are consistent with those described in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (see Note 2). Transactions between reportable segments principally consist of sales of pharmacy care products and services to UnitedHealthcare customers by Optum Rx; care delivery, care management services and certain product offerings sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Health; and health information and technology solutions, consulting and other services sold to UnitedHealthcare by Optum Insight. These transactions are recorded at management’s estimate of fair value. Transactions with affiliated customers are eliminated in consolidation. Assets and liabilities jointly used are assigned to each reportable segment using estimates of pro-rata usage. Cash and investments are assigned so each reportable segment has working capital and/or at least minimum specified levels of regulatory capital.\nTEXT: As a percentage of the Company’s total consolidated revenues, premium revenues from CMS were 40%, 38% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, most of which were generated by UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement and included in the UnitedHealthcare segment. U.S. customer revenue represented approximately 97% of consolidated total revenues for 2023, 2022 and 2021. Long-lived fixed assets located in the United States represented approximately 82% and 81% of the total long-lived fixed assets as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The non-U.S. revenues and fixed assets are primarily related to UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual’s international businesses.\n"
