Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nTEXT: The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nTEXT: The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nTEXT: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nTEXT: Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nTITLE: 14\nTEXT: The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of September 28, 2025 and December 29, 2024 were as follows:\nTEXT: September 28, 2025December 29, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $—815—815660Interest rate contracts(2)—589—5891,484Total —1,404—1,4042,144Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —370—370794Interest rate contracts(2) —5,695—5,6953,753Total —6,065—6,0654,547Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts —41—4150Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —28—2817Other Investments:Equity investments(3)573——573451Debt securities(4)—3,825—3,8257,216Other Liabilities:Contingent consideration(5)$——1,1101,1101,217\nTABLE: TABLE: September 28, 2025 December 29, 2024; (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total(1); Forward foreign exchange contracts $— 815 — 815 660; Interest rate contracts(2) — 589 — 589 1,484; Total — 1,404 — 1,404 2,144; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 370 — 370 794; Interest rate contracts(2) — 5,695 — 5,695 3,753; Total — 6,065 — 6,065 4,547; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 41 — 41 50; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 28 — 28 17; Equity investments(3) 573 — — 573 451; Debt securities(4) — 3,825 — 3,825 7,216; Contingent consideration(5) $— — 1,110 1,110 1,217.\nTITLE: September 28, 2025December 29, 2024\nTITLE: September 28, 2025\nTITLE: December 29, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Total(1)\nTITLE: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Total —1,404—1,4042,144\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Total —6,065—6,0654,547\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Other Investments:\nTITLE: Other Liabilities:\nTEXT: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationSeptember 28, 2025December 29, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Total Gross Assets$1,4452,194Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(1,238)(2,172)Total Net Asset20722Total Gross Liabilities6,0934,564Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(6,062)(4,412)Total Net Liabilities$31152\nTABLE: TABLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation September 28, 2025 December 29, 2024; Total Gross Assets $1,445 2,194; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (1,238) (2,172); Total Net Asset 207 22; Total Gross Liabilities 6,093 4,564; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (6,062) (4,412); Total Net Liabilities $31 152.\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationSeptember 28, 2025December 29, 2024\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\nTITLE: September 28, 2025\nTITLE: December 29, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTEXT: Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration for the fiscal third quarters ended September 28, 2025 and September 29, 2024 is as follows:\nTEXT: September 28, 2025September 29, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Beginning Balance$1,2171,092Changes in estimated fair value(6) (57)93Additions—112Payments(50)(75)Ending Balance$1,1101,222\nTABLE: TABLE: September 28, 2025 September 29, 2024; Beginning Balance $1,217 1,092; Changes in estimated fair value(6) (57) 93; Additions — 112; Payments (50) (75); Ending Balance $1,110 1,222.\nTITLE: September 28, 2025September 29, 2024\nTITLE: September 28, 2025\nTITLE: September 29, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTEXT: Changes in estimated fair value(6)\nTEXT: (1)2024 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $451 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $1,217 million, classified as Level 3.\nTEXT: (2)Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\nTEXT: (3)Classified as non-current other assets.\nTITLE: Form 10-Q15\n"

In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest all the talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nTEXT: In an effort to expeditiously resolve the litigation for the overwhelming majority of claimants, beginning in October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring, through which Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nTEXT: Following the 2021 Corporate Restructuring, Debtor and the Company attempted to achieve a full and comprehensive resolution of the Talc-Related Liabilities. Debtor filed voluntary petitions for Bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2021 and again in April 2023; both petitions were dismissed.\nTEXT: In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively\nTITLE: Form 10-Q31\n"

The claims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constituted 99.75% of then-pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products.\nTEXT: In August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (Red River); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (Pecos River); and (3) New Holdco (Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.\nTEXT: While the Company had resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date as of August 2024, cases continue to be filed. Trial activity has continued in various state courts.\nTEXT: In September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Shortly thereafter, as a consequence of this filing, the Company withdrew its appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision.\nTEXT: To account for the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $5.0 billion during fiscal year 2024. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the total present value of the reserve was approximately $11.6 billion (or nominal value of approximately $13.5 billion).\nTEXT: On March 31, 2025, the Texas Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the case (the Texas dismissal) and, as a result, the Company reversed substantially all, or approximately $7 billion, from amounts previously reserved for the bankruptcy resolution. As of the third quarter 2025, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $3.8 billion, comprising previously executed settlement agreements, litigation defense and other costs. Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability.\nTEXT: After the Texas dismissal, the Company announced it would not appeal the decision and returned to the tort system to litigate the talc claims and defend the safety of its products. Courts have been holding scheduling conferences and the Company is preparing to start bellwether trials in consolidated proceedings in the California JCCP in November 2025 and in the New Jersey MCL in January 2026. Additionally, ovarian cancer trials are being scheduled in various state courts throughout 2026 and beyond. In the MDL, the Court is addressing the Company's Daubert motions, which are expected to be decided by the first quarter of 2026.\nTEXT: In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc., and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc.

In October 2024, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Order).\nTEXT: Certain insurers have appealed the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the Settlement Order pending appeal, which the Delaware Bankruptcy Court denied in January 2025. The insurers then sought a stay of the Settlement Order in the District Court for the District of Delaware, which also was denied. The insurers then appealed the denial of their request for a stay of the Settlement Order to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In August 2025, the District Court denied the insurers' appeal of the Settlement Order. The insurers have appealed that decision to the Third Circuit. Both appeals are pending.\n"

Approximately 80% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal third quarter 2025. A few government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases.\nTEXT: The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases brought by private litigants.

However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nTITLE: DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nTEXT: Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\n"

In each of these lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset.

(Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the IRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies remains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs, implementation of the program is still in progress. In September 2025, a majority of the Third Circuit panel denied Janssen’s appeal of the district court’s decision.\nTEXT: The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges. The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nTEXT: The long-term implications of regional conflicts on the Company are difficult to predict. The financial impact of known existing conflicts in the fiscal third quarter of 2025 was not material.\nTEXT: Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nTEXT: The Company may be further impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any jurisdiction that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors.\nTEXT: The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of health care products.\nTEXT: Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing healthcare insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nTEXT: The Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products prior to the expiration of the applicable patents.

In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset.
