The firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (VIE). Voting Interest Entities. Voting interest entities are entities in which (i) the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable the entity to finance its activities independently and (ii) the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest. If the firm has a controlling majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity is consolidated. Variable Interest Entities. A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity. The firm has a controlling financial interest in a VIE when the firm has a variable interest or interests that provide it with (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 17 for further information about VIEs. Equity-Method Investments. When the firm does not have a controlling financial interest in an entity but can exert significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, the investment is generally accounted for at fair value by electing the fair value option available under U.S. GAAP. Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or in-substance common stock. In certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments. Investment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, discretionary compensation accruals, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, but actual results could be materially different. Revenue Recognition Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\n"

Significant influence generally exists when the firm owns 20% to 50% of the entity’s common stock or in-substance common stock.\nTEXT: In certain cases, the firm applies the equity method of accounting to new investments that are strategic in nature or closely related to the firm’s principal business activities, when the firm has a significant degree of involvement in the cash flows or operations of the investee or when cost-benefit considerations are less significant. See Note 8 for further information about equity-method investments.\nTEXT: Investment Funds. The firm has formed investment funds with third-party investors. These funds are typically organized as limited partnerships or limited liability companies for which the firm acts as general partner or manager. Generally, the firm does not hold a majority of the economic interests in these funds. These funds are usually voting interest entities and generally are not consolidated because third-party investors typically have rights to terminate the funds or to remove the firm as general partner or manager. Investments in these funds are generally measured at net asset value (NAV) and are included in investments. See Notes 8, 18 and 22 for further information about investments in funds. Use of Estimates Preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions, the most important of which relate to fair value measurements, the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost, discretionary compensation accruals, accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best available information, but actual results could be materially different. Revenue Recognition Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value. Trading assets and liabilities and certain investments are carried at fair value either under the fair value option or in accordance with other U.S. GAAP. In addition, the firm has elected to account for certain of its loans and other financial assets and liabilities at fair value by electing the fair value option. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. Fair value gains or losses are generally included in market making or other principal transactions. See Note 4 for further information about fair value measurements.\nTEXT: Investment Funds.

The firm recognizes revenue earned from contracts with clients for services, such as investment banking, investment management, and execution and clearing (contracts with clients), when the performance obligations related to the underlying transaction are completed. Revenues from contracts with clients represent approximately 55% of total non-interest revenues for the three months ended September 2025 and approximately 50% of total non-interest revenues for the nine months ended September 2025 (each including approximately 85% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees), and approximately 50% of total non-interest revenues for the three months ended September 2024 and approximately 45% of total non-interest revenues for the nine months ended September 2024 (each including approximately 85% of investment banking revenues, approximately 95% of investment management revenues and all commissions and fees). See Note 25 for information about net revenues by business segment. Investment Banking Advisory. Fees from financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues when the services related to the underlying transaction are completed under the terms of the assignment. Non-refundable deposits and milestone payments in connection with financial advisory assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction or when the assignment is otherwise concluded. Expenses associated with financial advisory assignments are recognized when incurred and are included in transaction based expenses. Client reimbursements for such expenses are included in investment banking revenues. Underwriting. Fees from underwriting assignments are recognized in revenues upon completion of the underlying transaction based on the terms of the assignment. Expenses associated with underwriting assignments are generally deferred until the related revenue is recognized or the assignment is otherwise concluded. Such expenses are included in transaction based expenses for completed assignments. Investment Management The firm earns management fees and incentive fees for investment management services, which are included in investment management revenues. The firm makes payments to brokers and advisors related to the placement of the firm’s investment funds (distribution fees), which are included in transaction based expenses. Management Fees. Management fees for mutual funds are calculated as a percentage of daily NAV and are received monthly. Management fees for hedge funds are calculated as a percentage of month-end NAV and are generally received quarterly. Management fees for separately managed accounts are calculated as a percentage of either the daily or monthly NAV and are received quarterly. Management fees for private equity funds are calculated as a percentage of monthly invested capital or committed capital and are generally received quarterly, semi-annually or annually, depending on the fund. Management fees are recognized over time in the period the services are provided. Distribution fees paid by the firm are calculated based on either a percentage of the management fee, the investment fund’s NAV or the committed capital. Such fees are included in transaction based expenses. Incentive Fees. Incentive fees are calculated as a percentage of a fund’s or separately managed account’s return, or excess return above a specified benchmark or other performance target. Incentive fees are generally based on investment performance over a twelve-month period or over the life of a fund. Fees that are based on performance over a twelve-month period are subject to adjustment prior to the end of the measurement period. For fees that are based on investment performance over the life of the fund, future investment underperformance may require fees previously distributed to the firm to be returned to the fund. Incentive fees earned from a fund or separately managed account are recognized when it is probable that a significant reversal of such fees will not occur, which is generally when such fees are no longer subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. Therefore, incentive fees recognized during the period may relate to performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\n"

Commissions and fees are recognized on the day the trade is executed. The firm also provides third-party research services to clients in connection with certain soft-dollar arrangements. Third-party research costs incurred by the firm in connection with such arrangements are presented net within commissions and fees. Remaining Performance Obligations Remaining performance obligations are services that the firm has committed to perform in the future in connection with its contracts with clients. The firm’s remaining performance obligations are generally related to its financial advisory assignments and certain investment management activities. Revenues associated with remaining performance obligations relating to financial advisory assignments cannot be determined until the outcome of the transaction. For the firm’s investment management activities, where fees are calculated based on the NAV of the fund or separately managed account, future revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations cannot be determined as such fees are subject to fluctuations in the market value of investments held by the fund or separately managed account. The firm is able to determine the future revenues associated with management fees calculated based on committed capital. As of September 2025, substantially all future net revenues associated with such remaining performance obligations will be recognized through 2033. Annual revenues associated with such performance obligations average less than $350 million through 2033. Transfers of Financial Assets Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when the firm has relinquished control over the assets transferred. For transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales, any gains or losses are recognized in net revenues. Assets or liabilities that arise from the firm’s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets are initially recognized at fair value. For transfers of financial assets that are not accounted for as sales, the assets are generally included in trading assets and the transfer is accounted for as a collateralized financing, with the related interest expense recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 11 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as collateralized financings and Note 16 for further information about transfers of financial assets accounted for as sales. Cash and Cash Equivalents The firm defines cash equivalents as highly liquid overnight deposits held in the ordinary course of business. Cash and cash equivalents included cash and due from banks of $6.88 billion as of September 2025 and $5.36 billion as of December 2024. Cash and cash equivalents also included interest-bearing deposits with banks of $162.70 billion as of September 2025 and $176.73 billion as of December 2024. The firm segregates cash for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. Cash and cash equivalents segregated for regulatory and other purposes were $16.45 billion as of September 2025 and $14.84 billion as of December 2024. In addition, the firm segregates securities for regulatory and other purposes related to client activity. See Note 11 for further information about segregated securities. Customer and Other Receivables Customer and other receivables included receivables from customers and counterparties of $111.08 billion as of September 2025 and $92.88 billion as of December 2024, and receivables from brokers, dealers and clearing organizations of $65.52 billion as of September 2025 and $40.84 billion as of December 2024. Such receivables primarily consist of customer margin loans, collateral posted in connection with certain derivative transactions, and receivables resulting from unsettled transactions.Substantially all of these receivables are accounted for at amortized cost net of any allowance for credit losses, which generally approximates fair value. As these receivables are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these receivables been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, substantially all would have been classified in level 2 as of both September 2025 and December 2024.

Contract assets represent the firm’s right to receive consideration for services provided in connection with its contracts with clients for which collection is conditional and not merely subject to the passage of time.

An enforceable credit support agreement grants the non-defaulting party exercising termination rights the right to liquidate the collateral and apply the proceeds to any amounts owed. In order to assess enforceability of the firm’s right of setoff under netting and credit support agreements, the firm evaluates various factors, including applicable bankruptcy laws, local statutes and regulatory provisions in the jurisdiction of the parties to the agreement.Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) in the consolidated balance sheets when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement. Resale agreements and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities borrowed and loaned transactions with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis in the consolidated balance sheets when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. In the consolidated balance sheets, derivatives are reported net of cash collateral received and posted under enforceable credit support agreements, when transacted under an enforceable netting agreement. In the consolidated balance sheets, resale and repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed and loaned, are not reported net of the related cash and securities received or posted as collateral. See Note 11 for further information about collateral received and pledged, including rights to deliver or repledge collateral. See Notes 7 and 11 for further information about offsetting assets and liabilities. Share-Based CompensationThe cost of employee services received in exchange for a share-based award is generally measured based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Share-based awards that do not require future service (i.e., vested awards, including awards granted to retirement-eligible employees) are expensed immediately. Share-based awards that require future service are amortized over the relevant service period. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. Cash dividend equivalents paid on restricted stock units (RSUs) are generally charged to retained earnings. If RSUs that require future service are forfeited, the related dividend equivalents originally charged to retained earnings are reclassified to compensation expense in the period in which forfeiture occurs. The firm generally issues new shares of common stock upon delivery of share-based awards. In limited cases, as outlined in the applicable award agreements, the firm may cash settle share-based awards accounted for as equity instruments. For these awards, additional paid-in capital is adjusted to the extent of the difference between the value of the award at the time of cash settlement and the grant-date value of the award. The tax effect related to the settlement of share-based awards and payments of dividend equivalents is recorded in income tax benefit or expense.Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the consolidated balance sheets and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement gains or losses on transactions in nonfunctional currencies are recognized in earnings. Gains or losses on translation of the financial statements of a non-U.S. operation, when the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are included, net of hedges and taxes, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\n"

Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2.

Fair Value Measurements The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices. Fair value measurements do not include transaction costs. The firm measures certain financial assets and liabilities as a portfolio (i.e., based on its net exposure to market and/or credit risks). The best evidence of fair value is a quoted price in an active market. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is determined by reference to prices for similar instruments, quoted prices or recent transactions in less active markets, or internally developed models that primarily use market-based or independently sourced inputs, including, but not limited to, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, credit spreads and funding spreads (i.e., the spread or difference between the interest rate at which a borrower could finance a given financial instrument relative to a benchmark interest rate). U.S. GAAP has a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. This hierarchy prioritizes inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, giving the highest priority to level 1 inputs and the lowest priority to level 3 inputs. A financial instrument’s level in this hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to its fair value measurement. In evaluating the significance of a valuation input, the firm considers, among other factors, a portfolio’s net risk exposure to that input. The fair value hierarchy is as follows: Level 1. Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets to which the firm had access at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. Level 2. Inputs to valuation techniques are observable, either directly or indirectly. Level 3. One or more inputs to valuation techniques are significant and unobservable. The fair values for substantially all of the firm’s financial assets and liabilities are based on observable prices and inputs and are classified in levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Certain level 2 and level 3 financial assets and liabilities may require valuation adjustments that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value for factors, such as counterparty and the firm’s credit quality, funding risk, transfer restrictions, liquidity and bid/offer spreads.

Valuation Techniques and Significant Inputs for Trading Cash Instruments, Investments and Loans Level 1. Level 1 instruments include U.S. government obligations, most non-U.S. government obligations, certain agency obligations, certain corporate debt instruments, certain money market instruments and actively traded listed equities. These instruments are valued using quoted prices for identical unrestricted instruments in active markets. The firm defines active markets for equity instruments based on the average daily trading volume both in absolute terms and relative to the market capitalization for the instrument. The firm defines active markets for debt instruments based on both the average daily trading volume and the number of days with trading activity. Level 2. Level 2 instruments include certain non-U.S. government obligations, most agency obligations, most mortgage-backed loans and securities, most corporate debt instruments, most state and municipal obligations, most money market instruments, most other debt obligations, restricted or less liquid listed equities, certain private equities, commodities and certain lending commitments.Valuations of level 2 instruments can be verified to quoted prices, recent trading activity for identical or similar instruments, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Consideration is given to the nature of the quotations (e.g., indicative or executable) and the relationship of recent market activity to the prices provided from alternative pricing sources. Valuation adjustments are typically made to level 2 instruments (i) if the instrument is subject to transfer restrictions and/or (ii) for other premiums and liquidity discounts that a market participant would require to arrive at fair value. Valuation adjustments are generally based on market evidence. Level 3. Level 3 instruments have one or more significant valuation inputs that are not observable. Absent evidence to the contrary, level 3 instruments are initially valued at transaction price, which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value. Subsequently, the firm uses other methodologies to determine fair value, which vary based on the type of instrument. Valuation inputs and assumptions are changed when corroborated by substantive observable evidence, including values realized on sales. Valuation techniques of level 3 instruments vary by instrument, but are generally based on discounted cash flow techniques. The valuation techniques and the nature of significant inputs used to determine the fair values of each type of level 3 instrument are described below: Loans and Securities Backed by Commercial Real Estate Loans and securities backed by commercial real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by a single property or a portfolio of properties, and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses and include: •Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets and/or current levels and changes in market indices, such as the CMBX (an index that tracks the performance of commercial mortgage bonds); •Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; •A measure of expected future cash flows in a default scenario (recovery rates) implied by the value of the underlying collateral, which is mainly driven by current performance of the underlying collateral and capitalization rates. Recovery rates are expressed as a percentage of notional or face value of the instrument and reflect the benefit of credit enhancements on certain instruments; and •Timing of expected future cash flows (duration) which, in certain cases, may incorporate the impact of any loan forbearances and other unobservable inputs (e.g., prepayment speeds). Loans and Securities Backed by Residential Real Estate Loans and securities backed by residential real estate are directly or indirectly collateralized by portfolios of residential real estate and may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. Significant inputs are generally determined based on relative value analyses, which incorporate comparisons to instruments with similar collateral and risk profiles. Significant inputs include: •Market yields implied by transactions of similar or related assets; •Transaction prices in both the underlying collateral and instruments with the same or similar underlying collateral; and•Duration, driven by underlying loan prepayment speeds and residential property liquidation timelines.\n"

Level 1 derivatives include short-term contracts for future delivery of securities when the underlying security is a level 1 instrument, and exchange-traded derivatives if they are actively traded and are valued at their quoted market price.Level 2. Level 2 derivatives include OTC derivatives for which all significant valuation inputs are corroborated by market evidence and exchange-traded derivatives that are not actively traded and/or that are valued using models that calibrate to market-clearing levels of OTC derivatives. The selection of a particular model to value a derivative depends on the contractual terms of and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. For derivatives that trade in liquid markets, model selection does not involve significant management judgment because outputs of models can be calibrated to market-clearing levels. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, such as contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, discount rates (including those derived from interest rates on collateral received and posted as specified in credit support agreements for collateralized derivatives), credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates, loss severity rates and correlations of such inputs. Significant inputs to the valuations of level 2 derivatives can be verified to market transactions, broker or dealer quotations or other alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.

In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives. Valuation Adjustments. Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received.

Such instruments include repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; certain customer and other receivables, including certain margin loans; certain time deposits, including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; substantially all other secured financings, including structured financing arrangements and transfers of assets accounted for as financings; certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments; and certain other assets and liabilities. These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm’s other financial assets and liabilities are described below. Resale and Repurchase Agreements and Securities Borrowed and Loaned. The significant inputs to the valuation of resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowed and loaned are funding spreads, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and interest rates. Customer and Other Receivables. The significant inputs to the valuation of receivables are interest rates, the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and funding spreads. Deposits. The significant inputs to the valuation of time deposits are interest rates and the amount and timing of future cash flows. The inputs used to value the embedded derivative component of hybrid financial instruments are consistent with the inputs used to value the firm’s other derivative instruments described above. See Note 7 for further information about derivatives and Note 13 for further information about deposits. Other Secured Financings. The significant inputs to the valuation of other secured financings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, volatility, funding spreads and the fair value of the collateral delivered by the firm (determined using the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, market prices, market yields and recovery assumptions). See Note 11 for further information about other secured financings. Unsecured Short- and Long-Term Borrowings. The significant inputs to the valuation of unsecured short- and long-term borrowings are the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, interest rates, volatility, the credit spreads of the firm and commodity prices for prepaid commodity transactions.

These instruments are generally valued based on discounted cash flow techniques, which incorporate inputs with reasonable levels of price transparency, and are generally classified in level 2 because the inputs are observable. Valuation adjustments may be made for liquidity and for counterparty and the firm’s credit quality. The significant inputs used to value the firm’s other financial assets and liabilities are described below.\nTEXT: Subsequent to the initial valuation of a level 3 derivative, the firm updates the level 1 and level 2 inputs to reflect observable market changes and any resulting gains and losses are classified in level 3. Level 3 inputs are changed when corroborated by evidence, such as similar market transactions, third-party pricing services and/or broker or dealer quotations or other empirical market data. In circumstances where the firm cannot verify the model value by reference to market transactions, it is possible that a different valuation model could produce a materially different estimate of fair value. See Note 5 for further information about significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of level 3 derivatives.\nTEXT: Valuation Adjustments. Valuation adjustments are integral to determining the fair value of derivative portfolios and are used to adjust the mid-market valuations produced by derivative pricing models to the exit price valuation. These adjustments incorporate bid/offer spreads, the cost of liquidity, and credit and funding valuation adjustments, which account for the credit and funding risk inherent in the uncollateralized portion of derivative portfolios. The firm also makes funding valuation adjustments to collateralized derivatives where the terms of the agreement do not permit the firm to deliver or repledge collateral received. Market-based inputs are generally used when calibrating valuation adjustments to market-clearing levels.\nTEXT: In addition, for derivatives that include significant unobservable inputs, the firm makes model or exit price adjustments to account for the valuation uncertainty present in the transaction.\n"

An average greater than the median indicates that the majority of inputs are below the average. For example, the difference between the average and the median for credit spreads indicates that the majority of the inputs fall in the lower end of the range. •The ranges, averages and medians of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one derivative. For example, the highest correlation for interest rate derivatives is appropriate for valuing a specific interest rate derivative but may not be appropriate for valuing any other interest rate derivative. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 derivatives.•Interest rates, currencies and equities derivatives are valued using option pricing models, credit derivatives are valued using option pricing, correlation and discounted cash flow models, and commodities derivatives are valued using option pricing and discounted cash flow models.•The fair value of any one instrument may be determined using multiple valuation techniques. For example, option pricing models and discounted cash flow models are typically used together to determine fair value. Therefore, the level 3 balance encompasses both of these techniques. •Correlation within currencies and equities includes cross-product type correlation. •Natural gas spread represents the spread per million British thermal units of natural gas.•Oil spread represents the spread per barrel of oil and refined products. •Electricity price represents the price per megawatt hour of electricity.Range of Significant Unobservable Inputs. The following provides information about the ranges of significant unobservable inputs used to value the firm’s level 3 derivative instruments: •Correlation. Ranges for correlation cover a variety of underliers both within one product type (e.g., equity index and equity single stock names) and across product types (e.g., correlation of an interest rate and a currency), as well as across regions. Generally, cross-product type correlation inputs are used to value more complex instruments and are lower than correlation inputs on assets within the same derivative product type.\n"

The following is a description of the directional sensitivity of the firm’s level 3 fair value measurements to changes in significant unobservable inputs, in isolation, as of each period-end:•Correlation. In general, for contracts where the holder benefits from the convergence of the underlying asset or index prices (e.g., interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, inflation rates and equity prices), an increase in correlation results in a higher fair value measurement. •Volatility. In general, for purchased options, an increase in volatility results in a higher fair value measurement. •Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates. In general, the fair value of purchased credit protection increases as credit spreads or upfront credit points increase or recovery rates decrease. Credit spreads, upfront credit points and recovery rates are strongly related to distinctive risk factors of the underlying reference obligations, which include reference entity-specific factors, such as leverage, volatility and industry, market-based risk factors, such as borrowing costs or liquidity of the underlying reference obligation, and macroeconomic conditions. •Commodity prices and spreads. In general, for contracts where the holder is receiving a commodity, an increase in the spread (price difference from a benchmark index due to differences in quality or delivery location) or price results in a higher fair value measurement. Due to the distinctive nature of each of the firm’s level 3 derivatives, the interrelationship of inputs is not necessarily uniform within each product type. Level 3 Rollforward.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTITLE: (Unaudited)\nTEXT: In the table above: •Ranges represent the significant unobservable inputs that were used in the valuation of each type of loan. •Weighted averages are calculated by weighting each input by the relative fair value of the loan. •The ranges and weighted averages of these inputs are not representative of the appropriate inputs to use when calculating the fair value of any one loan. For example, the highest yield for corporate loans is appropriate for valuing a specific corporate loan but may not be appropriate for valuing any other corporate loan. Accordingly, the ranges of inputs do not represent uncertainty in, or possible ranges of, fair value measurements of level 3 loans. •Increases in yield or duration used in the valuation of level 3 loans would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement, while increases in recovery rate would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement as of both September 2025 and December 2024.

These ranges and weighted averages exclude unobservable inputs that are only relevant to a single instrument, and therefore are not meaningful.

Gains/(losses) exclude related interest income and interest expense. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense.•Gains/(losses) included in market making are primarily related to the firm’s trading assets and liabilities, including both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.•Gains/(losses) are not representative of the manner in which the firm manages its business activities because many of the firm’s market-making and client facilitation strategies utilize financial instruments across various product types. Accordingly, gains or losses in one product type frequently offset gains or losses in other product types. For example, most of the firm’s longer-term derivatives across product types are sensitive to changes in interest rates and may be economically hedged with interest rate swaps. Similarly, a significant portion of the firm’s trading cash instruments and derivatives across product types has exposure to foreign currencies and may be economically hedged with foreign currency contracts.Note 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities Derivative Activities Derivatives are instruments that derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates and other inputs, or a combination of these factors. Derivatives may be traded on an exchange (exchange-traded) or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are usually referred to as OTC derivatives. Certain of the firm’s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared), while others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties (bilateral OTC). Market Making. As a market maker, the firm enters into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. In this role, the firm typically acts as principal and is required to commit capital to provide execution, and maintains market-making positions in response to, or in anticipation of, client demand. Risk Management. The firm also enters into derivatives to actively manage risk exposures that arise from its market-making and investing and financing activities. The firm’s holdings and exposures are hedged, in many cases, on either a portfolio or risk-specific basis, as opposed to an instrument-by-instrument basis. The offsetting impact of this economic hedging is reflected in the same business segment as the related revenues. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP. These derivatives are used to manage interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured borrowings and deposits and certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, foreign exchange risk of certain available-for-sale securities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and the exposure to the variability of the forecasted cash flows associated with certain floating-rate assets.The firm enters into various types of derivatives, including: •Futures and Forwards. Contracts that commit counterparties to purchase or sell financial instruments, commodities or currencies in the future. •Swaps. Contracts that require counterparties to exchange cash flows, such as currency or interest payment streams. The amounts exchanged are based on the specific terms of the contract with reference to specified rates, financial instruments, commodities, currencies or indices. •Options. Contracts in which the option purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to purchase from or sell to the option writer financial instruments, commodities or currencies within a defined time period for a specified price. Derivatives are reported on a net-by-counterparty basis (i.e., the net payable or receivable for derivative assets and liabilities for a given counterparty) when a legal right of setoff exists under an enforceable netting agreement (counterparty netting). Derivatives are accounted for at fair value, net of cash collateral received or posted under enforceable credit support agreements (cash collateral netting). Derivative assets are included in trading assets and derivative liabilities are included in trading liabilities. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on derivatives not designated as hedges are included in market making (for derivatives included in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities within Global Banking & Markets), and other principal transactions (for derivatives included in Investment banking fees and Other within Global Banking & Markets, as well as derivatives in Asset & Wealth Management) in the consolidated statements of earnings. For each of the three and nine months ended September 2025 and September 2024, substantially all of the firm’s derivatives were included in Global Banking & Markets.\n"

See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of derivatives, and Note 5 for further information about derivatives within the fair value hierarchy.Credit Derivatives The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. The firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: •Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract.•Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.\n"

See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of derivatives, and Note 5 for further information about derivatives within the fair value hierarchy.Credit Derivatives The firm enters into a broad array of credit derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage the credit risk associated with market-making and investing and financing activities. Credit derivatives are actively managed based on the firm’s net risk position. Credit derivatives are generally individually negotiated contracts and can have various settlement and payment conventions. Credit events include failure to pay, bankruptcy, acceleration of indebtedness, restructuring, repudiation and dissolution of the reference entity. The firm enters into the following types of credit derivatives: •Credit Default Swaps. Single-name credit default swaps protect the buyer against the loss of principal on one or more bonds, loans or mortgages (reference obligations) in the event the issuer of the reference obligations suffers a credit event. The buyer of protection pays an initial or periodic premium to the seller and receives protection for the period of the contract. If there is no credit event, as defined in the contract, the seller of protection makes no payments to the buyer. If a credit event occurs, the seller of protection is required to make a payment to the buyer, calculated according to the terms of the contract.•Credit Options. In a credit option, the option writer assumes the obligation to purchase or sell a reference obligation at a specified price or credit spread. The option purchaser buys the right, but does not assume the obligation, to sell the reference obligation to, or purchase it from, the option writer. The payments on credit options depend either on a particular credit spread or the price of the reference obligation.\nTEXT: •Tenor is based on the remaining contractual maturity for substantially all OTC derivative assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: •Counterparty netting within the same product type and tenor category is included within such product type and tenor category.\nTEXT: •Counterparty netting across product types within the same tenor category is included in counterparty netting in tenors.

Credit derivatives may reference a basket of single-name credit default swaps or a broad-based index. If a credit event occurs in one of the underlying reference obligations, the protection seller pays the protection buyer. The payment is typically a pro-rata portion of the transaction’s total notional amount based on the underlying defaulted reference obligation. In certain transactions, the credit risk of a basket or index is separated into various portions (tranches), each having different levels of subordination. The most junior tranches cover initial defaults and once losses exceed the notional amount of these junior tranches, any excess loss is covered by the next most senior tranche. •Total Return Swaps. A total return swap transfers the risks relating to economic performance of a reference obligation from the protection buyer to the protection seller. Typically, the protection buyer receives a floating rate of interest and protection against any reduction in fair value of the reference obligation, and the protection seller receives the cash flows associated with the reference obligation, plus any increase in the fair value of the reference obligation. The firm economically hedges its exposure to written credit derivatives primarily by entering into offsetting purchased credit derivatives with identical underliers. Substantially all of the firm’s purchased credit derivative transactions are with financial institutions and are subject to stringent collateral thresholds. In addition, upon the occurrence of a specified trigger event, the firm may take possession of the reference obligations underlying a particular written credit derivative, and consequently may, upon liquidation of the reference obligations, recover amounts on the underlying reference obligations in the event of default.

These derivatives are included in unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, as well as other secured financings, with the related borrowings. Derivatives with Credit-Related Contingent Features Certain of the firm’s derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require the firm to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in the firm’s credit ratings. The firm assesses the impact of these bilateral agreements by determining the collateral or termination payments that would occur assuming a downgrade by all rating agencies. A downgrade by any one rating agency, depending on the agency’s relative ratings of the firm at the time of the downgrade, may have an impact which is comparable to the impact of a downgrade by all rating agencies. The table below presents information about net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements (excluding collateral posted), the fair value of collateral posted and additional collateral or termination payments that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in the firm’s credit ratings. As ofSeptemberDecember$ in millions20252024Net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements$30,999 $31,575 Collateral posted$22,521 $20,262 Additional collateral or termination payments:One-notch downgrade$186 $315 Two-notch downgrade$1,427 $1,200 Hedge Accounting The firm applies hedge accounting for (i) interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term borrowings, certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit and certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale, (ii) foreign currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange risk of certain securities classified as available-for-sale, (iii) foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign exchange risk on the firm’s net investment in certain non-U.S. operations and (iv) interest rate swaps used to manage the variability of the forecasted cash flows associated with certain floating-rate assets.To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging instrument must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged. Additionally, the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and assess the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the hedging instrument continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship. Fair Value Hedges The firm designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of certain fixed-rate unsecured long- and short-term debt and fixed-rate certificates of deposit and of certain U.S. and non-U.S. government securities classified as available-for-sale. These interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Overnight Index Swap Rate or Sterling Overnight Index Average), effectively converting a substantial portion of these fixed-rate financial instruments into floating-rate financial instruments. The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of these hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged (i.e., interest rate risk). An interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%.\n"

Cash Flow Hedges The firm designates certain interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These interest rate swaps hedge the firm’s exposure to the variability of the forecasted cash flows due to changes in the contractually specified interest rates associated with certain floating-rate assets. The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing hedge effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is considered highly effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted cash flows attributable to the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the gains or losses on derivatives are included in “Cash flow hedges” within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Such gains or losses are reclassified to interest income/expense within the consolidated statements of earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The gains/(losses) included within other comprehensive income/(loss) and the gains/(losses) reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) related to cash flow hedges were not material for both the three and nine months ended September 2025 and are not expected to be material for the next 12 months.

These interest rate swaps hedge the firm’s exposure to the variability of the forecasted cash flows due to changes in the contractually specified interest rates associated with certain floating-rate assets. The firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing hedge effectiveness. A cash flow hedge is considered highly effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted cash flows attributable to the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% or greater and a slope between 80% and 125%. For qualifying cash flow hedges, the gains or losses on derivatives are included in “Cash flow hedges” within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Such gains or losses are reclassified to interest income/expense within the consolidated statements of earnings in the same period that the forecasted hedged cash flows impact earnings. The gains/(losses) included within other comprehensive income/(loss) and the gains/(losses) reclassified to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) related to cash flow hedges were not material for both the three and nine months ended September 2025 and are not expected to be material for the next 12 months. The maximum length of time over which the forecasted cash flows are hedged is approximately one year.Note 8. Investments Investments includes debt securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity that are generally held in connection with the firm’s asset-liability management activities. In addition, investments includes equity securities and debt instruments that are accounted for at fair value and equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method that are generally held by the firm in connection with its long-term investing activities.\nTEXT: Gains or losses on individual net investments in non-U.S. operations are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) to earnings when such net investments are sold or substantially liquidated.

Corporate loans includes term loans, revolving lines of credit, letter of credit facilities and bridge loans, and are principally used for operating and general corporate purposes, or in connection with acquisitions. Corporate loans are secured (typically by a senior lien on the assets of the borrower) or unsecured, depending on the loan purpose, the risk profile of the borrower and other factors. •Commercial Real Estate. Commercial real estate loans includes originated loans that are directly or indirectly secured by hotels, retail stores, multifamily housing complexes and commercial and industrial properties. Commercial real estate loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly backed by commercial real estate. In addition, commercial real estate includes loans purchased by the firm. •Residential Real Estate. Residential real estate loans primarily includes loans extended to wealth management clients and to clients who warehouse assets that are directly or indirectly secured by residential real estate. In addition, residential real estate includes loans purchased by the firm.•Securities-Based. Securities-based loans includes loans that are secured by stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds. These loans are primarily extended to the firm’s wealth management clients and used for purposes other than purchasing, carrying or trading margin stocks. Securities-based loans require borrowers to post additional collateral on a daily basis (daily margin requirement) based on changes in the underlying collateral’s fair value.•Other Collateralized. Other collateralized loans includes loans that are backed by specific collateral (other than securities-based loans where there is a daily margin requirement and real estate loans). Such loans include loans to investment funds (managed by third parties) that are collateralized by capital commitments of the funds’ investors or assets held by the fund. Other collateralized loans also includes loans extended to clients who warehouse assets (that are directly or indirectly secured by corporate loans, consumer loans and other assets), as well as other secured loans extended to the firm’s wealth management and corporate clients. •Credit Cards. Credit card loans are loans made pursuant to revolving lines of credit issued to consumers by the firm. •Other. Other loans primarily includes unsecured loans extended to wealth management clients and unsecured consumer loans purchased by the firm. See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.Credit Quality Risk Assessment. The firm’s risk assessment process includes evaluating the credit quality of its loans by Risk. For corporate loans and a majority of securities-based, real estate, other collateralized and other loans, the firm performs credit analyses which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a borrower to meet its financial obligations. These credit evaluations are performed on an annual basis or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. The firm determines an internal credit rating for the borrower by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the borrower’s industry and the economic environment. For collateralized loans, the firm also takes into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements when determining an internal credit rating. For credit card loans and for loans that are not assigned an internal credit rating, including U.S. residential mortgage loans extended to wealth management clients, the firm reviews certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, loan to value ratios, delinquency status, collateral value and other risk factors.\n"

Nonaccrual, Past Due and Modified Loans. Loans accounted for at amortized cost (other than credit card loans) are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that the firm will not collect all principal and interest due under the contractual terms, regardless of the delinquency status or if a loan is past due for 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well collateralized and in the process of collection. At that time, all accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income and interest subsequently collected is recognized on a cash basis to the extent the loan balance is deemed collectible. Otherwise, all cash received is used to reduce the outstanding loan balance. A loan is considered past due when a principal or interest payment has not been made according to its contractual terms. Credit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and accrue interest until the loan is paid in full or is charged off.

Loans and lending commitments accounted for at fair value or accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value are not subject to an allowance for credit losses. To determine the allowance for credit losses, the firm classifies its loans and lending commitments accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolios. These portfolios represent the level at which the firm has developed and documented its methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics using a modeled approach and on an asset-specific basis for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include multiple economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios described below. The firm applies judgment in weighing individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including the firm’s internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among others, changes and trends in loan portfolios, uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, credit concentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due and criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration within an industry or region. Management’s estimate of credit losses entails judgment about the expected life of the loan and loan collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves senior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While management uses the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used.

The allowance for credit losses for wholesale loans and lending commitments that exhibit similar risk characteristics is measured using a modeled approach. These models determine the probability of default and loss given default based on various risk factors, including internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators, the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. For lending commitments, the methodology also considers the probability of drawdowns or funding. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for wholesale loans and lending commitments include unemployment rates, GDP, credit spreads, commercial and industrial delinquency rates, short- and long-term interest rates, and oil prices. The allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if applicable. Wholesale loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when such loans are determined to be uncollectible. Such determination is based on several factors, which may include the expected outcome of loan restructuring efforts and the valuation of the underlying collateral. Consumer. The allowance for credit losses for consumer loans that exhibit similar risk characteristics is calculated using a modeled approach which classifies consumer loans into pools based on borrower-related and exposure-related characteristics that differentiate a pool’s risk characteristics from other pools. The factors considered in determining a pool are generally consistent with the risk characteristics used for internal credit risk measurement and management and include key metrics, such as FICO credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The most significant inputs to the forecast model for consumer loans include unemployment rates and delinquency rates. The expected life of revolving credit card loans is determined by modeling expected future draws and the timing and amount of repayments allocated to the funded balance. The firm does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on credit card lending commitments as they are cancellable by the firm. Credit card loans are charged off when they are 180 days past due.

Fair Value Option Other Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to: •Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; •Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and •Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). Unless the firm has elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value under the fair value option, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the associated host contract, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges. Other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value under the fair value option include: •Repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements; •Certain securities borrowed and loaned transactions; •Certain customer and other receivables and certain other assets and liabilities; •Certain time deposits (deposits with no stated maturity are not eligible for a fair value option election), including structured certificates of deposit, which are hybrid financial instruments; •Substantially all other secured financings, including structured financing arrangements and transfers of assets accounted for as financings; and •Certain unsecured short- and long-term borrowings, substantially all of which are hybrid financial instruments. See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of other financial assets and liabilities, and Note 5 for information about other financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy.Gains and Losses on Other Financial Assets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value Under the Fair Value Option The table below presents the gains and losses recognized in earnings as a result of the election to apply the fair value option to certain financial assets and liabilities.

Fair Value Option Other Financial Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value In addition to trading assets and liabilities, and certain investments and loans, the firm accounts for certain of its other financial assets and liabilities at fair value, substantially all under the fair value option. The primary reasons for electing the fair value option are to: •Reflect economic events in earnings on a timely basis; •Mitigate volatility in earnings from using different measurement attributes (e.g., transfers of financial assets accounted for as financings are recorded at fair value, whereas the related secured financing would be recorded on an accrual basis absent electing the fair value option); and •Address simplification and cost-benefit considerations (e.g., accounting for hybrid financial instruments at fair value in their entirety versus bifurcation of embedded derivatives and hedge accounting for debt hosts). Hybrid financial instruments are instruments that contain bifurcatable embedded derivatives and do not require settlement by physical delivery of nonfinancial assets (e.g., physical commodities). Unless the firm has elected to account for the entire hybrid financial instrument at fair value under the fair value option, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the associated host contract, the derivative is accounted for at fair value and the host contract is accounted for at amortized cost, adjusted for the effective portion of any fair value hedges.\nTITLE: Estimated Fair Value\nTEXT: The table below presents the estimated fair value of loans that are not accounted for at fair value and in what level of the fair value hierarchy they would have been classified if they had been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: Carrying ValueEstimated Fair Value$ in millionsLevel 2Level 3TotalAs of September 2025 Amortized cost$214,379 $110,254 $106,095 $216,349 Held for sale$2,502 $1,772 $758 $2,530 As of December 2024 Amortized cost$187,215 $99,790 $89,540 $189,330 Held for sale$3,525 $2,928 $600 $3,528\nTABLE: TABLE: Carrying Value Estimated Fair Value; $ in millions Level 2 Level 3 Total; Amortized cost $ 214,379 $ 110,254 $ 106,095 $ 216,349; Held for sale $ 2,502 $ 1,772 $ 758 $ 2,530; Amortized cost $ 187,215 $ 99,790 $ 89,540 $ 189,330; Held for sale $ 3,525 $ 2,928 $ 600 $ 3,528.\nTITLE: As of September 2025\nTITLE: Amortized cost$214,379 $110,254 $106,095 $216,349\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 214,379\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 110,254\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 106,095\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 216,349\nTITLE: Held for sale$2,502 $1,772 $758 $2,530\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,502\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,772\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 758\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,530\nTEXT: See Note 4 for an overview of the firm’s fair value measurement policies, valuation techniques and significant inputs used to determine the fair value of loans, and Note 5 for information about loans within the fair value hierarchy.\nTITLE: Fair Value Option\n"

Collateralized Agreements and Financings Collateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities. Collateralized agreements and financings with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. Even though repurchase and resale agreements (including “repos- and reverses-to-maturity”) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency obligations, and investment-grade sovereign obligations. The firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these financial instruments on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the financial instruments, as appropriate. For resale agreements, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the relevant assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Repurchase agreements and substantially all resale agreements are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about repurchase and resale agreements.Securities Borrowed and Loaned Transactions In a securities borrowed transaction, the firm borrows securities from a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the firm returns the securities, the counterparty returns the cash or securities. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. In a securities loaned transaction, the firm lends securities to a counterparty in exchange for cash or securities. When the counterparty returns the securities, the firm returns the cash or securities posted as collateral. Interest is generally paid periodically over the life of the transaction. In a transaction where the firm lends securities and receives securities that can be delivered or pledged as collateral, the firm recognizes the securities received within securities borrowed and the obligation to return those securities within securities loaned in the consolidated balance sheets.The firm receives securities borrowed and makes delivery of securities loaned. To mitigate credit exposure, the firm monitors the market value of these securities on a daily basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the market value of the securities, as appropriate. For securities borrowed transactions, the firm typically requires collateral with a fair value approximately equal to the carrying value of the securities borrowed transaction. Securities borrowed and loaned within FICC financing are recorded at fair value under the fair value option. See Note 5 for further information about securities borrowed and loaned accounted for at fair value. Substantially all of the securities borrowed and loaned within Equities financing are recorded based on the amount of cash collateral advanced or received plus accrued interest. The firm also reviews such securities borrowed to determine if an allowance for credit losses should be recorded by taking into consideration the fair value of collateral received. As these agreements generally can be terminated on demand, they exhibit little, if any, sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the carrying value of such agreements approximates fair value. As these agreements are not accounted for at fair value, they are not included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy in Notes 4 and 5. Had these agreements been included in the firm’s fair value hierarchy, they would have been classified in level 2 as of both September 2025 and December 2024.\n"

Collateralized Agreements and Financings Collateralized agreements are resale agreements and securities borrowed. Collateralized financings are repurchase agreements, securities loaned and other secured financings. The firm enters into these transactions in order to, among other things, facilitate client activities, invest excess cash, acquire securities to cover short positions and finance certain firm activities. Collateralized agreements and financings with the same settlement date are presented on a net-by-counterparty basis when such transactions meet certain settlement criteria and are subject to netting agreements. Interest on collateralized agreements, which is included in interest income, and collateralized financings, which is included in interest expense, is recognized over the life of the transaction. See Note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense. Resale and Repurchase Agreements A resale agreement is a transaction in which the firm purchases financial instruments from a seller, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the firm sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a stated price plus accrued interest at a future date. Even though repurchase and resale agreements (including “repos- and reverses-to-maturity”) involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be repurchased or resold before or at the maturity of the agreement. The financial instruments purchased or sold in resale and repurchase agreements typically include U.S. government and agency obligations, and investment-grade sovereign obligations. The firm receives financial instruments purchased under resale agreements and makes delivery of financial instruments sold under repurchase agreements.

In addition, the firm will recognize an impairment prior to the sale of an asset or asset group if the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.

Goodwill Goodwill is the cost of acquired companies in excess of the fair value of net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, at the acquisition date.

When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment.The quantitative goodwill test compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value (including goodwill and identifiable intangible assets). If the reporting unit’s estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. An impairment is recognized if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value and any such impairment is included in depreciation and amortization. When performing a quantitative goodwill test, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit is based on valuation techniques the firm believes market participants would use to value these reporting units. Estimated fair values are generally derived from utilizing a relative value technique, which applies observable price-to-earnings multiples or price-to-book multiples of comparable competitors to the reporting units’ net earnings or net book value, or a discounted cash flow valuation approach, for reporting units with businesses in early stages of development. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the firm performed its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, for each of its reporting units with goodwill, by performing a qualitative assessment. Multiple factors, including performance indicators, macroeconomic indicators, firm and industry events, and fair value indicators, were assessed with respect to each of these reporting units to determine whether it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of those reporting units was less than its carrying value. As a result of the qualitative assessment, the firm determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with goodwill exceeded its respective carrying value. Therefore, the firm determined that goodwill for each reporting unit was not impaired and that a quantitative goodwill test was not required.There were no events or changes in circumstances during either the three or nine months ended September 2025 that would indicate that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of each of the reporting units with goodwill did not exceed its respective carrying value as of September 2025.

Other than as noted above, there were no material impairments or write-downs during each of the three and nine months ended September 2025 and September 2024.Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets The firm enters into operating leases for real estate, office equipment and other assets, substantially all of which are used in connection with its operations. For leases longer than one year, the firm recognizes a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the liability to make payments. The lease term is generally determined based on the contractual maturity of the lease. For leases where the firm has the option to terminate or extend the lease, an assessment of the likelihood of exercising the option is incorporated into the determination of the lease term. Such assessment is initially performed at the inception of the lease and is updated if events occur that impact the original assessment. An operating lease right-of-use asset is initially determined based on the operating lease liability, adjusted for initial direct costs, lease incentives and amounts paid at or prior to lease commencement. This amount is then amortized over the lease term. Right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities recognized (in non-cash transactions for leases entered into or assumed) by the firm were $113 million for the three months ended September 2025, $56 million for the three months ended September 2024, $236 million for the nine months ended September 2025 and $109 million for the nine months ended September 2024. See Note 15 for information about operating lease liabilities. For leases where the firm will derive no economic benefit from leased space that it has vacated or where the firm has shortened the term of a lease when space is no longer needed, the firm will record an impairment or accelerated amortization of right-of-use assets. There were no material impairments or accelerated amortizations during each of the three and nine months ended September 2025 and September 2024.Miscellaneous Receivables and Other Miscellaneous receivables and other included:•Investments in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects of $3.34 billion as of September 2025 and $3.46 billion as of December 2024. The firm receives tax credits for such investments. See Note 17 for further information about these investments.•Assets classified as held for sale were $101 million as of September 2025 and $517 million as of December 2024. See below for further information. Assets Held for Sale. Assets held for sale included $101 million as of September 2025 and $517 million as of December 2024 of assets that were primarily related to certain of the firm’s consolidated investments within Asset & Wealth Management.

See Note 7 for further information about hedging activities. Junior Subordinated Debt In 2004, Group Inc. issued $2.84 billion of junior subordinated debt to Goldman Sachs Capital I, a Delaware statutory trust. Goldman Sachs Capital I issued $2.75 billion of guaranteed preferred beneficial interests (Trust Preferred securities) to third parties and $85 million of common beneficial interests to Group Inc. As of both September 2025 and December 2024, the outstanding par amount of junior subordinated debt held by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $968 million and the outstanding par amount of Trust Preferred securities and common beneficial interests issued by Goldman Sachs Capital I was $939 million and $29 million, respectively. Goldman Sachs Capital I is a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of the firm for regulatory and legal purposes but is not consolidated for accounting purposes. The firm pays interest semi-annually on the junior subordinated debt at an annual rate of 6.345% and the debt matures on February 15, 2034. The coupon rate and the payment dates applicable to the beneficial interests are the same as the interest rate and payment dates for the junior subordinated debt. The firm has the right, from time to time, to defer payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt, and therefore cause payment on Goldman Sachs Capital I’s preferred beneficial interests to be deferred, in each case up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods. During any such deferral period, the firm will not be permitted to, among other things, pay dividends on or make certain repurchases of its common stock. Goldman Sachs Capital I is not permitted to pay any distributions on the common beneficial interests held by Group Inc. unless all dividends payable on the preferred beneficial interests have been paid in full.

Variable Interest Entities A variable interest in a VIE is an investment (e.g., debt or equity) or other interest (e.g., derivatives or loans and lending commitments) that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected losses and/or receive portions of the VIE’s expected residual returns. The firm’s variable interests in VIEs include senior and subordinated debt; loans and lending commitments; limited and general partnership interests; preferred and common equity; derivatives that may include foreign currency, equity and/or credit risk; guarantees; and certain of the fees the firm receives from investment funds. Certain interest rate, foreign currency and credit derivatives the firm enters into with VIEs are not variable interests because they create, rather than absorb, risk. VIEs generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are either collateralized by or indexed to the assets held by the VIE. The debt and equity securities issued by a VIE may include tranches of varying levels of subordination. The firm’s involvement with VIEs includes securitization of financial assets, as described in Note 16, and investments in and loans to other types of VIEs, as described below. See Note 3 for the firm’s consolidation policies, including the definition of a VIE. VIE Consolidation Analysis The enterprise with a controlling financial interest in a VIE is known as the primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The firm determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by performing an analysis that principally considers: •Which variable interest holder has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; •Which variable interest holder has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE; •The VIE’s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders; •The VIE’s capital structure; •The terms between the VIE and its variable interest holders and other parties involved with the VIE; and •Related-party relationships. The firm reassesses its evaluation of whether an entity is a VIE when certain reconsideration events occur. The firm reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis based on current facts and circumstances.\n"

The firm sells residential and commercial mortgage loans and securities to mortgage-backed VIEs and may retain beneficial interests in the assets sold to these VIEs. The firm purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by mortgage-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives with certain of these VIEs, primarily interest rate swaps, which are typically not variable interests. The firm generally enters into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk. Tax Credit and Other Investing VIEs. The firm makes equity investments in VIEs that invest in qualified affordable housing and renewable energy projects designed to generate a return through the realization of tax credits and related tax benefits. The firm also purchases equity and debt securities issued by and makes loans to VIEs that hold real estate, performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans and equity securities. In addition, the firm makes equity investments in certain investment fund VIEs it manages and is entitled to receive fees from these VIEs. The firm generally does not sell assets to, or enter into derivatives with, these VIEs. Corporate Debt and Other Asset-Backed VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue notes to clients, purchases and sells beneficial interests issued by corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs in connection with market-making activities, and makes loans to VIEs that warehouse corporate debt. Certain of these VIEs synthetically create the exposure for the beneficial interests they issue by entering into credit derivatives with the firm, rather than purchasing the underlying assets. In addition, the firm may enter into derivatives, such as total return swaps, with certain corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs, under which the firm pays the VIE a return due to the beneficial interest holders and receives the return on the collateral owned by the VIE. The collateral owned by these VIEs is primarily other asset-backed loans and securities. The firm may be removed as the total return swap counterparty and may enter into derivatives with other counterparties to mitigate its risk related to these swaps. The firm may sell assets to the corporate debt and other asset-backed VIEs it structures. Principal-Protected Note VIEs. The firm structures VIEs that issue principal-protected notes to clients. These VIEs own portfolios of assets, principally with exposure to hedge funds. Substantially all of the principal protection on the notes issued by these VIEs is provided by the asset portfolio rebalancing that is required under the terms of the notes. The firm enters into total return swaps with these VIEs under which the firm pays the VIE the return due to the principal-protected note holders and receives the return on the assets owned by the VIE.

The estimated fair value of such lending commitments was a liability of $5.68 billion as of September 2025 and $4.84 billion as of December 2024. Had these lending commitments been carried at fair value and included in the fair value hierarchy, $3.33 billion as of September 2025 and $2.44 billion as of December 2024 would have been classified in level 2, and $2.35 billion as of September 2025 and $2.40 billion as of December 2024 would have been classified in level 3. •Held for sale lending commitments are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value. The carrying value of lending commitments held for sale was a liability of $65 million as of September 2025 and $43 million as of December 2024.

The firm’s commercial lending commitments were primarily extended to investment-grade corporate borrowers. Such commitments primarily related to relationship lending activities (principally used for operating and general corporate purposes), and other investment banking activities (generally extended for contingent acquisition financing and are often intended to be short-term in nature, as borrowers often seek to replace them with other funding sources). The firm also extends lending commitments in connection with commercial real estate financing and other collateralized lending. See Note 9 for further information about funded loans. To mitigate the credit risk associated with the firm’s commercial lending activities, the firm obtains credit protection on certain loans and lending commitments through credit default swaps, both single-name and index-based contracts. Warehouse Financing. The firm provides financing to clients who warehouse financial assets. These arrangements are collateralized by the warehoused assets, primarily consisting of residential real estate, consumer and corporate loans. Credit Cards. The firm provides credit to consumers by issuing credit card lines. These credit card lines are cancellable by the firm. As of December 2024, credit card lines included $14.32 billion of commitments classified as held for sale in connection with the planned sale of the GM co-branded credit card program. During the third quarter of 2025, the firm completed the sale of this program.Risk Participations The firm also risk participates certain of its commercial lending commitments to other financial institutions. In the event of a risk participant’s default, the firm will be responsible to fund the borrower. Collateralized Agreement Commitments/ Collateralized Financing Commitments Collateralized agreement commitments includes forward starting resale and securities borrowing agreements, and collateralized financing commitments includes forward starting repurchase and secured lending agreements that settle at a future date. Collateralized agreement commitments also includes transactions where the firm has entered into commitments to provide contingent financing to its clients and counterparties through resale agreements. The firm’s funding of these commitments depends on the satisfaction of all contractual conditions to the resale agreement and these commitments can expire unused. Investment Commitments Investment commitments includes commitments to invest in private equity, real estate and other assets directly and through funds that the firm raises and manages. Investment commitments included $1.12 billion as of September 2025 and $1.10 billion as of December 2024, related to commitments to invest in funds managed by the firm. If these commitments are called, they would be funded at market value on the date of investment. Contingencies Legal Proceedings. See Note 27 for information about legal proceedings.

The firm enters into various derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP, including written equity and commodity put options, written currency contracts and interest rate caps, floors and swaptions. These derivatives are risk managed together with derivatives that do not meet the definition of a guarantee, and therefore the amounts in the table above do not reflect the firm’s overall risk related to derivative activities. Disclosures about derivatives are not required if they may be cash settled and the firm has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counterparties held the underlying instruments at the inception of the contract. The firm has concluded that these conditions have been met for certain large, internationally active commercial and investment bank counterparties, central clearing counterparties, hedge funds and certain other counterparties. Accordingly, the firm has not included such contracts in the table above. See Note 7 for information about credit derivatives that meet the definition of a guarantee, which are not included in the table above. Derivatives are accounted for at fair value and therefore the carrying value is considered the best indication of payment/performance risk for individual contracts. However, the carrying values in the table above exclude the effect of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Securities Lending and Clearing Guarantees. Securities lending and clearing guarantees include the indemnifications and guarantees that the firm provides in its capacity as an agency lender and in its capacity as a sponsoring member of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. As an agency lender, the firm indemnifies most of its securities lending customers against losses incurred in the event that borrowers do not return securities and the collateral held is insufficient to cover the market value of the securities borrowed. The maximum payout of such indemnifications was $16.30 billion as of September 2025 and $10.62 billion as of December 2024. Collateral held by the lenders in connection with securities lending indemnifications was $16.93 billion as of September 2025 and $11.02 billion as of December 2024. Because the contractual nature of these arrangements requires the firm to obtain collateral with a market value that exceeds the value of the securities lent to the borrower, there is minimal performance risk associated with these indemnifications. As a sponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the firm guarantees the performance of its sponsored member clients to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation in connection with certain resale and repurchase agreements. To minimize potential losses on such guarantees, the firm obtains a security interest in the collateral that the sponsored client placed with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. Therefore, the risk of loss on such guarantees is minimal. The maximum payout on this guarantee was $134.23 billion as of September 2025 and $47.44 billion as of December 2024. The related collateral held was $134.09 billion as of September 2025 and $46.96 billion as of December 2024. Other Financial Guarantees. In the ordinary course of business, the firm provides other financial guarantees of the obligations of third parties (e.g., standby letters of credit and other guarantees to enable clients to complete transactions and fund-related guarantees). These guarantees represent obligations to make payments to beneficiaries if the guaranteed party fails to fulfill its obligation under a contractual arrangement with that beneficiary. Other financial guarantees also include a guarantee that the firm has provided to the Government of Malaysia that it would receive, by August 2025, at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a sovereign wealth fund in Malaysia (1MDB). The firm initiated arbitration against the Government of Malaysia in October 2023 concerning its approach to recovering and crediting assets under the guarantee and the arbitral process is ongoing. In August 2025, the Government of Malaysia made a demand for a final payment of approximately $1 billion towards the guarantee. The firm believes that the Government of Malaysia has recovered in excess of $1.4 billion in creditable assets and that no payment should be required. Final determinations on all issues, including whether any payment is required, will be made through the arbitral process. See Note 27 for further information about matters related to 1MDB.Guarantees of Securities Issued by Trusts. The firm has established trusts, including Goldman Sachs Capital I, Goldman Sachs Capital II and Goldman Sachs Capital III (the Trusts), and other entities, for the limited purpose of issuing securities to third parties, lending the proceeds to the firm and entering into contractual arrangements with the firm and third parties related to this purpose. The firm does not consolidate these entities. See Notes 14 and 19 for further information about the transactions involving the Trusts.\n"

Timely payment by the firm of amounts due to these entities under the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements will be sufficient to cover payments due on the securities issued by these entities. No subsidiary of Group Inc. guarantees the securities of the Trusts. Management believes that it is unlikely that any circumstances will occur, such as nonperformance on the part of paying agents or other service providers, that would make it necessary for the firm to make payments related to these entities other than those required under the terms of the guarantee, borrowing, preferred stock and related contractual arrangements and in connection with certain expenses incurred by these entities. Indemnities and Guarantees of Service Providers. In the ordinary course of business, the firm indemnifies and guarantees certain service providers, such as clearing and custody agents, trustees and administrators, against specified potential losses in connection with their acting as an agent of, or providing services to, the firm or its affiliates. The firm may also be liable to some clients or other parties for losses arising from its custodial role or caused by acts or omissions of third-party service providers, including sub-custodians and third-party brokers. In certain cases, the firm has the right to seek indemnification from these third-party service providers for certain relevant losses incurred by the firm. In addition, the firm is a member of payment, clearing and settlement networks, as well as securities exchanges around the world that may require the firm to meet the obligations of such networks and exchanges in the event of member defaults and other loss scenarios. In connection with the firm’s prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the firm agrees to clear and settle transactions entered into by clients with other brokerage firms. The firm’s obligations in respect of such transactions are secured by the assets in the client’s account and proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of the client. In connection with joint venture investments, the firm may issue loan guarantees under which it may be liable in the event of fraud, misappropriation, environmental liabilities and other matters involving the borrower. The firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications as this depends upon the occurrence of future events, including an assessment of claims that have not yet occurred. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these guarantees and indemnifications have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both September 2025 and December 2024. Other Representations, Warranties and Indemnifications. The firm provides representations and warranties to counterparties in connection with a variety of commercial transactions and occasionally indemnifies them against potential losses caused by the breach of those representations and warranties. The firm may also provide indemnifications protecting against changes in or adverse application of certain U.S. tax laws in connection with ordinary-course transactions, such as securities issuances, borrowings or derivatives. In addition, the firm may provide indemnifications to some counterparties to protect them in the event additional taxes are owed or payments are withheld, due either to a change in or an adverse application of certain non-U.S. tax laws. These indemnifications, as well as indemnifications provided by the firm on other contractual or other obligations, generally are standard contractual terms and are entered into in the ordinary course of business. Generally, there are no stated or notional amounts included in these indemnifications, and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify are not expected to occur. Future changes in tax laws and how such laws would apply to these indemnifications cannot be determined. Therefore, the firm is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum payout under these guarantees and indemnifications. However, management believes that it is unlikely the firm will have to make any material payments under these arrangements, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as of both September 2025 and December 2024.

Group Inc. has guaranteed the payment obligations of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (GS&Co.), GS Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Paris Inc. et Cie, subject to certain exceptions. Group Inc. also guarantees many of the obligations of its other consolidated subsidiaries on a transaction-by-transaction basis, as negotiated with counterparties. In addition, Group Inc. has provided guarantees to Goldman Sachs International (GSI) and GSBE related to agreements that each entity has entered into with certain of its counterparties. Given the obligations of the consolidated subsidiaries are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets or reflected as commitments, Group Inc.’s liabilities as guarantor are not separately disclosed.\n"

Shareholders’ Equity Common Equity As of both September 2025 and December 2024, the firm had 4.00 billion authorized shares of common stock and 200 million authorized shares of nonvoting common stock, each with a par value of $0.01 per share. The firm’s share repurchase program is intended to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. The share repurchase program is effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by the firm’s current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by the evolution of current and future regulatory capital requirements, general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of the firm’s common stock.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\nTEXT: The table below presents preferred stock dividends declared. 20252024Seriesper share$ in millionsper share$ in millionsThree Months Ended SeptemberA$335.68 $9 $413.68 $12 C$335.68 2 $413.68 4 D$330.63 18 $408.45 22 E$1,369.51 11 $1,629.22 13 F$1,370.15 3 $1,629.85 3 P$– – $552.33 33 Q$922.38 19 $687.50 14 R$945.00 23 $618.75 15 S$898.25 12 $550.00 7 U$456.25 13 $456.25 13 W$937.50 57 $937.50 56 Z$932.36 71 $– – Total$238 $192 Nine Months Ended SeptemberA$1,016.67 $30 $1,215.99 $36 C$1,016.67 8 $1,215.99 10 D$1,001.56 54 $1,200.65 65 E$4,118.75 32 $4,911.94 38 F$4,120.64 7 $4,913.85 8 K$– – $796.88 20 O$662.50 17 $662.50 17 P$– – $1,623.09 97 Q$1,844.75 37 $1,375.00 28 R$1,563.75 38 $1,237.50 30 S$1,448.25 20 $1,100.00 15 T$475.00 13 $475.00 13 U$912.50 27 $912.50 27 V$515.63 15 $515.63 15 W$1,875.00 113 $1,833.33 110 X$937.50 84 $– – Y$952.78 77 $– – Z$932.36 71 $– – Total$643 $529 On October 6, 2025, Group Inc. declared dividends of $330.99 per share of Series A Preferred Stock, $330.99 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, $325.93 per share of Series D Preferred Stock, $662.50 per share of Series O Preferred Stock, $475.00 per share of Series T Preferred Stock, $515.63 per share of Series V Preferred Stock, $937.50 per share of Series X Preferred Stock, and $765.63 per share of Series Y Preferred Stock to be paid on November 10, 2025 to preferred shareholders of record on October 26, 2025 and declared dividends of $1,300.04 per share of Series E Preferred Stock and $1,300.67 per share of Series F Preferred Stock to be paid on December 1, 2025 to preferred shareholders of record on November 16, 2025.

Regulation and Capital Adequacy The FRB is the primary regulator of Group Inc., a bank holding company under the U.S. Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under amendments to this Act. The firm is subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements which are calculated in accordance with the regulations of the FRB (Capital Framework). The capital requirements are expressed as risk-based capital and leverage ratios that compare measures of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets (RWAs), average assets and off-balance sheet exposures. Failure to comply with these capital requirements would result in restrictions being imposed by the firm’s regulators and could limit the firm’s ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends and make certain discretionary compensation payments. The firm’s capital levels are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components of capital, risk weightings and other factors. Furthermore, certain of the firm’s subsidiaries are subject to separate regulations and capital requirements.\nTITLE: Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)\nTEXT: The table below presents changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), net of tax, by type.\nTEXT: $ in millionsBeginning balance Other comprehensiveincome/(loss)adjustments,net of taxEnding balance Three Months Ended September 2025Currency translation$(885)$23 $(862)Debt valuation adjustment(316)(711)(1,027)Pension and postretirement liabilities(505)11 (494)Available-for-sale securities(279)185 (94)Cash flow hedges– 1 1 Total$(1,985)$(491)$(2,476)Three Months Ended September 2024Currency translation$(825)$(25)$(850)Debt valuation adjustment(411)(95)(506)Pension and postretirement liabilities(553)13 (540)Available-for-sale securities(1,111)504 (607)Total$(2,900)$397 $(2,503)Nine Months Ended September 2025Currency translation$(815)$(47)$(862)Debt valuation adjustment(386)(641)(1,027)Pension and postretirement liabilities(528)34 (494)Available-for-sale securities(972)878 (94)Cash flow hedges(1)2 1 Total$(2,702)$226 $(2,476)Nine Months Ended September 2024Currency translation$(847)$(3)$(850)Debt valuation adjustment(123)(383)(506)Pension and postretirement liabilities(575)35 (540)Available-for-sale securities(1,373)766 (607)Total$(2,918)$415 $(2,503)\nTABLE: TABLE: $ in millions Beginning balance Other comprehensiveincome/(loss)adjustments,net of tax Ending balance; Currency translation $ (885) $ 23 $ (862); Debt valuation adjustment (316) (711) (1,027); Pension and postretirement liabilities (505) 11 (494); Available-for-sale securities (279) 185 (94); Cash flow hedges – 1 1; Total $ (1,985) $ (491) $ (2,476); Currency translation $ (825) $ (25) $ (850); Debt valuation adjustment (411) (95) (506); Pension and postretirement liabilities (553) 13 (540); Available-for-sale securities (1,111) 504 (607); Total $ (2,900) $ 397 $ (2,503); Currency translation $ (815) $ (47) $ (862); Debt valuation adjustment (386) (641) (1,027); Pension and postretirement liabilities (528) 34 (494); Available-for-sale securities (972) 878 (94); Cash flow hedges (1) 2 1; Total $ (2,702) $ 226 $ (2,476); Currency translation $ (847) $ (3) $ (850); Debt valuation adjustment (123) (383) (506); Pension and postretirement liabilities (575) 35 (540); Available-for-sale securities (1,373) 766 (607); Total $ (2,918) $ 415 $ (2,503).\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 2025\nTITLE: Currency translation$(885)$23 $(862)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (885)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 23\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (862)\nTITLE: Debt valuation adjustment(316)(711)(1,027)\nTITLE: (316)\nTITLE: (711)\nTITLE: (1,027)\nTITLE: Pension and postretirement liabilities(505)11 (494)\nTITLE: (505)\nTITLE: 11\nTITLE: (494)\nTITLE: Available-for-sale securities(279)185 (94)\nTITLE: (279)\nTITLE: 185\nTITLE: (94)\nTITLE: Cash flow hedges– 1 1\nTITLE: –\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: Total$(1,985)$(491)$(2,476)\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (1,985)\nTITLE: $\n"

Method 1 is based on the Basel Committee’s methodology which, among other factors, relies upon measures of the size, interconnectedness, substitutability, complexity and cross-jurisdictional activities of each G-SIB. Method 2 uses similar inputs but includes a measure of reliance on short-term wholesale funding instead of substitutability. As of both September 2025 and December 2024, the G-SIB surcharge (Method 2) was higher and therefore was reflected in the capital conservation buffer requirements.•In June 2025, the FRB disclosed that the firm’s stress capital buffer (SCB), from the 2024 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test, has been reduced from 6.2% to 6.1%. The impact of this change would have been a reduction of 10 basis points to the December 2024 Standardized CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital ratio requirements presented in the table above.Additionally, based on the firm’s 2025 CCAR submission, the FRB has set the SCB for the firm at 3.4% beginning on October 1, 2025, which will decrease the firm’s Standardized requirement to 10.9% for the CET1 capital ratio, 12.4% for the Tier 1 capital ratio and 14.4% for the Total capital ratio. The SCB may be subject to further changes pending the finalization of the FRB’s outstanding proposal on SCB averaging.The table below presents information about risk-based capital ratios. $ in millionsStandardizedAdvancedAs of September 2025 CET1 capital$103,769 $103,769 Tier 1 capital$118,515 $118,515 Tier 2 capital$14,209 $10,164 Total capital$132,724 $128,679 RWAs$723,406 $687,426 CET1 capital ratio14.3%15.1%Tier 1 capital ratio16.4%17.2%Total capital ratio18.3%18.7%As of December 2024 CET1 capital$103,065 $103,065 Tier 1 capital$115,647 $115,647 Tier 2 capital$14,125 $10,164 Total capital$129,772 $125,811 RWAs$688,541 $674,812 CET1 capital ratio15.0%15.3%Tier 1 capital ratio16.8%17.1%Total capital ratio18.8%18.6%In the table above, the Standardized risk-based capital ratios as of September 2025 decreased compared with December 2024, reflecting an increase in Credit RWAs, partially offset by an increase in capital and a decrease in Market RWAs.

As of both September 2025 and December 2024, GS Bank USA was subject to and in compliance with applicable capital requirements for swap dealers and security-based swap dealers. Restrictions on Payments Group Inc. may be limited in its ability to access capital held at certain subsidiaries as a result of regulatory, tax or other constraints. These limitations include provisions of applicable law and regulations and other regulatory restrictions that limit the ability of those subsidiaries to declare and pay dividends without prior regulatory approval. For example, the amount of dividends that may be paid by GS Bank USA are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. In addition, subsidiaries not subject to separate regulatory capital requirements may hold capital to satisfy local tax and legal guidelines, rating agency requirements (for entities with assigned credit ratings) or internal policies, including policies concerning the minimum amount of capital a subsidiary should hold based on its underlying level of risk. Group Inc.’s equity investment in subsidiaries was $144.77 billion as of September 2025 and $140.79 billion as of December 2024. The firm’s regulated subsidiaries were required to hold minimum equity capital of $110.98 billion as of September 2025 and $98.48 billion as of December 2024 to satisfy regulatory requirements. Group Inc.’s capital invested in certain non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries is exposed to foreign exchange risk, substantially all of which is managed through a combination of non-U.S. dollar-denominated debt and derivatives.

Note 24. Income Taxes Provision for Income Taxes Income taxes are provided for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. The firm reports interest expense related to income tax matters in provision for taxes and income tax penalties in other expenses. Deferred Income Taxes Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized and primarily relate to the ability to utilize losses and tax credits in various tax jurisdictions. Tax assets are included in other assets and tax liabilities are included in other liabilities. Unrecognized Tax Benefits The firm recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Regulatory Tax Examinations The firm is subject to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other taxing authorities in jurisdictions where the firm has significant business operations, such as the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong and various states, such as New York. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction. The firm does not expect completion of these audits to have a material impact on the firm’s financial condition, but it may be material to operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period.\nTEXT: Note 23.

As ofJurisdictionSeptember 2025U.S. Federal2011New York State and City2015United Kingdom2017Japan2019Hong Kong2019The firm has been accepted into the Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program by the IRS for each of the tax years from 2013 through 2025. This program allows the firm to work with the IRS to identify and resolve potential U.S. federal tax issues before the filing of tax returns. All issues addressed through the CAP program for the 2011 through 2018 tax years have been resolved and completion is pending final review by the Joint Committee on Taxation. All issues for the 2019 through 2022 tax years have been resolved and will be effectively settled pending administrative completion by the IRS. Final completion of tax years 2011 through 2022 will not have a material impact on the effective tax rate. The 2023 and 2024 tax years remain subject to post-filing review. New York State and City examinations of tax years 2015 through 2018 commenced during 2021.All years, including and subsequent to the years in the table above, remain open to examination by the taxing authorities. The firm believes that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits it has established is adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments.Note 25. Business Segments The firm manages and reports its activities in three business segments: Global Banking & Markets, Asset & Wealth Management and Platform Solutions. These business segments are determined and organized based on products and services provided, and the types of customers and counterparties served. See Note 1 for a description of the firm’s business segments. The firm’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is its president and chief operating officer. The CODM makes operating decisions, assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, the firm’s operating segments principally based on the total net revenues of the segments, revenues net of provision for credit losses, total operating expenses, pre-tax earnings, net earnings applicable to common shareholders and the return on average common equity to assess the performance of the segments. The CODM evaluates segment operating performance against the firm’s targets and industry metrics and considers the current and future business and operating environment.The accounting policies used to prepare the operating results and other metrics for the segments are consistent with those described in Note 3. The following provides a description of the primary components of the firm’s segment results disclosed in the table below.•The firm fully allocates its revenues, expenses, assets and shareholders’ equity to the firm’s three business segments.•Revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining pre-tax earnings for the respective segment. •Net revenues in the firm’s segments include allocations of interest income and interest expense based on the funding generated by, or the funding and liquidity requirements of the respective segments. Net interest is included in segment net revenues as it is consistent with how management assesses segment performance. •Expenses not directly associated with specific segments are allocated among the business segments based on an estimate of support provided to each segment. •Compensation and benefits expenses in the firm’s segments reflect, among other factors, the overall performance of the firm, as well as the performance of individual businesses. Consequently, pre-tax margins in one segment of the firm’s business may be significantly affected by the performance of the firm’s other business segments.•Certain assets (including allocations of global core liquid assets and cash, and secured client financing), not directly associated with specific segments are generally allocated among the business segments based on the funding and liquidity requirements of the segments. •Common shareholders’ equity and preferred stock dividends are allocated to each segment based on the estimated amount of equity required to support the activities of the segment under relevant regulatory capital requirements. •Net earnings for each segment is calculated by applying the firmwide tax rate to each segment’s pre-tax earnings. •Management believes that this allocation provides a reasonable representation of each segment’s contribution to consolidated net earnings to common, return on average common equity and total assets. Due to the integrated nature of these segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating these assets, revenues and expenses. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates.\n"

Note 26. Credit Concentrations The firm’s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market-making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse or exchange. The firm seeks to mitigate credit risk by actively monitoring exposures and obtaining collateral from counterparties as deemed appropriate. The firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts. Netting and collateral agreements permit the firm to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties and/or enable the firm to obtain collateral on an upfront or contingent basis. The table below presents the credit concentrations included in trading cash instruments and investments.

Credit Concentrations The firm’s concentrations of credit risk arise from its market-making, client facilitation, investing, underwriting, lending and collateralized transactions, and cash management activities, and may be impacted by changes in economic, industry or political factors. These activities expose the firm to many different industries and counterparties, and may also subject the firm to a concentration of credit risk to a particular central bank, counterparty, borrower or issuer, including sovereign issuers, or to a particular clearinghouse or exchange.

The firm measures and monitors its credit exposure based on amounts owed to the firm after taking into account risk mitigants that the firm considers when determining credit risk. Such risk mitigants include netting and collateral arrangements and economic hedges, such as credit derivatives, futures and forward contracts.

On November 1, 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed a criminal information and guilty plea by Tim Leissner, a former participating managing director of the firm, and an indictment against Ng Chong Hwa, a former managing director of the firm. On August 28, 2018, Leissner was adjudicated guilty by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York of conspiring to launder money and to violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act’s (FCPA) anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions. Ng was charged with conspiring to launder money and to violate the FCPA’s anti-bribery and internal accounting controls provisions, and on April 8, 2022, Ng was found guilty on all counts following a trial. On August 18, 2020, the firm announced that it entered into a settlement agreement with the Government of Malaysia to resolve the criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia involving the firm, which includes a guarantee that the Government of Malaysia receives at least $1.4 billion in assets and proceeds from assets seized by governmental authorities around the world related to 1MDB. See Note 18 for further information about this guarantee, including related arbitration proceedings. On October 22, 2020, the firm announced that it reached settlements of governmental and regulatory investigations relating to 1MDB with the DOJ, the SEC, the FRB, the NYDFS, the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Singapore Attorney General’s Chambers, the Singapore Commercial Affairs Department, the Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission. Group Inc. entered into a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with the DOJ, in which a charge against the firm, one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, was filed and was later dismissed on May 6, 2024 in accordance with the agreement. In addition, GS Malaysia pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the FCPA, and was sentenced on June 9, 2021. In May 2021, the U.S. Department of Labor granted the firm a five-year exemption to maintain its status as a qualified professional asset manager (QPAM).On December 20, 2018, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against Group Inc. and certain former officers of the firm alleging violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Exchange Act with respect to Group Inc.’s disclosures and public statements concerning 1MDB and seeking unspecified damages. The plaintiff filed the second amended complaint on October 28, 2019. On June 28, 2021, the court dismissed the claims against one of the individual defendants but denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to the firm and the remaining individual defendants. On August 4, 2023, the plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. On September 4, 2025, the court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification in part. On September 18, 2025, the defendants filed a petition with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit seeking interlocutory review of the district court’s grant of class certification.\n"

Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of these cases seek an indeterminate amount of damages. We have estimated the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss for matters where we have been able to estimate a range and we believe, based on currently available information, that the results of matters where we have not been able to estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but may be material to our operating results in a given period. Given the range of litigation and investigations presently under way, our litigation expenses may remain high. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Use of Estimates” in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q.

We generated net earnings of $4.10 billion for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $2.99 billion for the third quarter of 2024. Diluted earnings per common share (EPS) was $12.25 for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $8.40 for the third quarter of 2024. Annualized return on average common shareholders’ equity (ROE) was 14.2% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 10.4% for the third quarter of 2024. Book value per common share was $353.79 as of September 2025, 1.2% higher compared with June 2025 and 5.1% higher compared with December 2024. Net revenues were $15.18 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 20% higher than the third quarter of 2024, reflecting higher net revenues across all segments. The increase in net revenues in Global Banking & Markets primarily reflected significantly higher Investment banking fees and higher net revenues in Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities (FICC) and Equities. The increase in net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management primarily reflected higher Management and other fees and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending. The increase in Platform Solutions net revenues primarily reflected a net loss in the prior year period related to the General Motors (GM) credit card program that was transferred to held for sale. Provision for credit losses was $339 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $397 million for the third quarter of 2024. Provisions for the third quarter of 2025 primarily reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (driven by net charge-offs). Provisions for the third quarter of 2024 reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (primarily driven by net charge-offs), partially offset by a net benefit related to the wholesale portfolio (driven by recoveries on previously impaired loans). Operating expenses were $9.45 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 14% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting increases in compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), transaction based expenses, charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings. Our efficiency ratio (total operating expenses divided by total net revenues) was 62.3% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 65.5% for the third quarter of 2024.\n"

Business Environment During the third quarter of 2025, global economic activity remained resilient, including in the U.S., but continued to be impacted by inflationary pressures, ongoing geopolitical concerns and uncertainty resulting from changes in international trade policies (including tariffs). Markets continued to be focused on the timing and amount of policy interest rate cuts by central banks globally, including the first rate cut this year by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Global equity prices were generally higher compared with the end of the second quarter of 2025, with some equity indices reaching record highs.There remains uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical risks, inflation, central bank policies and international trade policies (including tariffs).

The increase in net revenues in Global Banking & Markets primarily reflected significantly higher net revenues in Equities, higher Investment banking fees and higher net revenues in FICC. The increase in net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management reflected higher Management and other fees and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in both Equity investments and Debt investments. The increase in Platform Solutions net revenues primarily reflected a net loss in the prior year period related to the GM credit card program that was transferred to held for sale.\nTEXT: Provision for credit losses was $1.01 billion for the first nine months of 2025, compared with $997 million for the first nine months of 2024. Provisions for the first nine months of 2025 reflected net provisions related to the credit card portfolio (driven by net charge-offs) and wholesale loans (primarily driven by impairments).

When broker or dealer quotations or third-party pricing vendors are used for valuation or price verification, greater priority is generally given to executable quotations. •Calibration to Market Comparables. Market-based transactions are used to corroborate the valuation of positions with similar characteristics, risks and components. •Relative Value Analyses. Market-based transactions are analyzed to determine the similarity, measured in terms of risk, liquidity and return, of one instrument relative to another or, for a given instrument, of one maturity relative to another. •Collateral Analyses.

The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include multiple economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if applicable. Risk factors for credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among others, changes and trends in loan portfolios, uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, credit concentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due and criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration within an industry or region. Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves senior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible. We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. To estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of September 2025 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in the fourth quarter of 2025 through the third quarter of 2026, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $0.7 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of September 2025. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.Use of Estimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining discretionary compensation accruals, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.\n"

Risk factors for credit card loans include Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores, delinquency status, loan vintage and macroeconomic indicators. The allowance for credit losses also includes qualitative components which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting, capture uncertainty regarding model inputs, and account for model imprecision and concentration risk. The qualitative factors considered by management include, among others, changes and trends in loan portfolios, uncertainties associated with the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, credit concentrations, changes in volume and severity of past due and criticized loans, idiosyncratic events and deterioration within an industry or region. Our estimate of credit losses entails judgment about collectability at the reporting dates, and there are uncertainties inherent in those judgments. The allowance for credit losses is subject to a governance process that involves senior management within Risk and Controllers. Personnel within Risk are responsible for forecasting the economic variables that underlie the economic scenarios that are used in the modeling of expected credit losses. While we use the best information available to determine this estimate, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on, among other things, changes in the economic environment or variances between actual results and the original assumptions used. Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nTEXT: The allowance for credit losses takes into account the weighted average of a range of forecasts of future economic conditions over the expected life of the loans and lending commitments. The expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension options or demand features, or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loans. The forecasts include multiple economic scenarios over a three-year period. For loans with expected lives beyond three years, the model reverts to historical loss information based on a non-linear modeled approach. We apply judgment in weighting individual scenarios each quarter based on a variety of factors, including our internally derived economic outlook, market consensus, recent macroeconomic conditions and industry trends. The forecasted economic scenarios consider a number of risk factors relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolios. Risk factors for wholesale loans include internal credit ratings, industry default and loss data, expected life, macroeconomic indicators (e.g., unemployment rates and GDP), the borrower’s capacity to meet its financial obligations, the borrower’s country of risk and industry, loan seniority and collateral type. In addition, for loans backed by real estate, risk factors include the loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio and home price index. The allowance for loan losses for wholesale loans that do not share similar risk characteristics, such as nonaccrual loans, is calculated using the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or, in the case of collateral dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell, if applicable.

Loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when deemed to be uncollectible.\nTEXT: We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost. Such allowance is determined using the same methodology as the allowance for loan losses, while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding, and whether such commitments are cancellable by us. To estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit losses, we, among other things, compared the expected credit losses under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit losses as of September 2025 (which was weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenarios) to the expected credit losses under a 100% weighted adverse economic scenario. The adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects a global recession in the fourth quarter of 2025 through the third quarter of 2026, resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rates. A 100% weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate $0.7 billion increase in our allowance for credit losses as of September 2025. This hypothetical increase does not take into consideration any potential adjustments to qualitative reserves. The forecasts of macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effects. The actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the allowance for credit losses.Use of Estimates U.S. GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. In addition to the estimates we make in connection with fair value measurements and the allowance for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost, the use of estimates and assumptions is also important in determining discretionary compensation accruals, the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, provisions for losses that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceedings (including governmental investigations), and accounting for income taxes.\nTEXT: We also record an allowance for credit losses on lending commitments which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost.

We believe the most appropriate way to allocate estimated year-end discretionary compensation among interim periods is in proportion to the net revenues net of provision for credit losses earned in such periods. In addition to the level of net revenues net of provision for credit losses, our overall compensation expense in any given year is also influenced by, among other factors, overall financial performance, prevailing labor markets, business mix, the structure of our share-based awards and the external environment.Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate an impairment may exist. When assessing goodwill for impairment, first, a qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, a quantitative goodwill test is performed. Alternatively, a quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing a qualitative assessment. Estimating the fair value of our reporting units requires judgment. Critical inputs to the fair value estimates include projected earnings, allocated equity, price-to-earnings multiples and price-to-book multiples. There is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings. The carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholders’ equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholders’ equity required to support the activities of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirements. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our reporting units or our common stock price, or additional increases in capital requirements, our goodwill could be impaired in the future. Identifiable intangible assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances suggest that an asset’s or asset group’s carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Judgment is required to evaluate whether indications of potential impairment have occurred, and to test identifiable intangible assets for impairment, if required. An impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to the asset or asset group is less than the corresponding carrying value. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about identifiable intangible assets.We also estimate and provide for potential losses that may arise out of litigation and regulatory proceedings to the extent that such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserves for litigation and regulatory proceedings where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight. See Notes 18 and 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information about certain judicial, litigation and regulatory proceedings. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates and our final liabilities may ultimately be materially different. Our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceedings is determined on a case-by-case basis and represents an estimate of probable losses after considering, among other factors, the progress of each case, proceeding or investigation, our experience and the experience of others in similar cases, proceedings or investigations, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In accounting for income taxes, we recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. We use estimates to recognize current and deferred income taxes in the U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. The income tax laws in these jurisdictions are complex and can be subject to different interpretations between taxpayers and taxing authorities. Disputes may arise over these interpretations and can be settled by audit, administrative appeals or judicial proceedings. We do not expect that the resolution of any such dispute will have a material impact on our financial condition, but it may be material to the operating results for a particular period, depending, in part, on the operating results for that period. Our interpretations are reevaluated quarterly based on guidance currently available, tax examination experience and the opinions of legal counsel, among other factors. We recognize deferred taxes based on the amount that will more likely than not be realized in the future based on enacted income tax laws. Our estimate for deferred taxes includes estimates for future taxable earnings, including the level and character of those earnings, and various tax planning strategies.

Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2025, the operating environment was generally characterized by prolonged geopolitical tensions and continued broad macroeconomic concerns, including concerns and uncertainty about inflation, central bank policies and changes in international trade policies (including tariffs). Industry-wide investment banking activity levels experienced an increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes and equity underwriting volumes compared with the second quarter of 2025, while debt underwriting volumes were lower. In market making, activity levels decreased compared with the prior quarter. Additionally, global equity prices were generally higher compared with the end of the second quarter of 2025. In the U.S., the rate of unemployment remained low and the pace of growth in consumer spending improved compared with the second quarter of 2025. If uncertainty and concerns about geopolitical tensions and the economic outlook remain elevated or grow, including those about inflation, central bank policies, the duration of the current federal government shutdown in the U.S. and changes in international trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, a further decline in market-making activity levels, or a decline in investment banking activity levels, and net revenues and provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted. See “Segment Assets and Operating Results — Segment Operating Results” for information about the operating environment and material trends and uncertainties that may impact our results of operations. Three Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Net revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $15.18 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 20% higher than the third quarter of 2024, reflecting significantly higher net interest income, investment banking revenues and commissions and fees, and higher investment management revenues, partially offset by lower market making revenues. Non-Interest Revenues. Investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $2.66 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 43% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to significantly higher revenues in advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, and in debt underwriting, primarily driven by an increase in leveraged finance activity. Investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $2.95 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 11% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher management and other fees, primarily reflecting the impact of higher average assets under supervision (AUS). Commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $1.11 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 27% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting a loss in the prior year period related to the GM credit card program that was transferred to held for sale and higher commissions and fees in Equities, reflecting generally higher market volumes and increased transaction fees. Market making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $3.87 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 6% lower than the third quarter of 2024, reflecting significantly lower net revenues from intermediation activities, partially offset by higher net revenues from financing activities. The decrease from intermediation activities primarily reflected significantly lower revenues in currencies and equity products, partially offset by significantly higher revenues in interest rate products. The increase from financing activities reflected higher revenues in equities financing. Other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $743 million for the third quarter of 2025, 11% lower than the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting significantly lower net gains from derivatives related to our funding activities. Net Interest Income. Net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $3.85 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 64% higher than the third quarter of 2024, reflecting a decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in interest income. The decrease in interest expense primarily related to other interest-bearing liabilities, deposits and borrowings (each reflecting the impact of lower average interest rates), partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to trading liabilities (reflecting the impact of higher average balances). The decrease in interest income primarily related to deposits with banks and collateralized agreements (each reflecting the impact of lower average interest rates and lower average balances), partially offset by an increase in interest income related to investments (reflecting the impact of higher average balances).

Our efficiency ratio was 62.3% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 65.5% for the third quarter of 2024. The increase in operating expenses, compared with the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflected increases in compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), transaction based expenses, charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives (in other expenses) and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (in other expenses). Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $131 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $41 million for the third quarter of 2024.As of September 2025, headcount increased by 4% compared with September 2024, primarily due to an increase in Asset & Wealth Management. As of September 2025, headcount increased 5% compared with June 2025, reflecting the timing of campus hires. Nine Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $27.82 billion for the first nine months of 2025, 9% higher than the first nine months of 2024. Our efficiency ratio was 62.1% for the first nine months of 2025, compared with 64.3% for the first nine months of 2024. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, was 32.5% for the first nine months of 2025, compared with 33.0% for the first half of 2025 and 33.5% for the first nine months of 2024.The increase in operating expenses, compared with the first nine months of 2024, reflected increases in compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), transaction based expenses and charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives (in other expenses). These increases were partially offset by significantly lower expenses, including impairments, from CIEs (primarily in depreciation and amortization, occupancy and other expenses). Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $121 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared with $168 million for the first nine months of 2024.As of September 2025, headcount increased by 4% compared with December 2024, primarily due to an increase in Asset & Wealth Management. In the first nine months of 2025, we recognized severance expense of approximately $170 million, which was largely in connection with a headcount reduction initiative in the second quarter of 2025. During the fourth quarter of 2025, we announced a multi-year initiative, OneGS 3.0, to transform our operating model. We expect that the new operating model will drive efficiencies and create capacity for future growth. We will constrain headcount growth through the end of 2025, in addition to a limited reduction in roles.Provision for Taxes The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was 21.5%, down from the full year effective tax rate of 22.4% for 2024, primarily due to an increase in tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards, partially offset by a decrease in other permanent tax benefits, for the first nine months of 2025 compared with the full year of 2024. The increase compared with 20.2% for the first half of 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in the impact of tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards. The impact of tax benefits related to employee share-based awards was a reduction to provision for taxes for the first nine months of 2025 of approximately $610 million, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.8 percentage points, and increased our diluted EPS by $1.91 and annualized ROE by 0.7 percentage points.\n"

Our efficiency ratio was 62.3% for the third quarter of 2025, compared with 65.5% for the third quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: The increase in operating expenses, compared with the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflected increases in compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), transaction based expenses, charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives (in other expenses) and net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings (in other expenses). Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $131 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $41 million for the third quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: As of September 2025, headcount increased by 4% compared with September 2024, primarily due to an increase in Asset & Wealth Management. As of September 2025, headcount increased 5% compared with June 2025, reflecting the timing of campus hires.\nTEXT: Nine Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings were $27.82 billion for the first nine months of 2025, 9% higher than the first nine months of 2024. Our efficiency ratio was 62.1% for the first nine months of 2025, compared with 64.3% for the first nine months of 2024. The ratio of compensation and benefits to net revenues, net of provision for credit losses, was 32.5% for the first nine months of 2025, compared with 33.0% for the first half of 2025 and 33.5% for the first nine months of 2024.The increase in operating expenses, compared with the first nine months of 2024, reflected increases in compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance), transaction based expenses and charitable contributions to Goldman Sachs Gives (in other expenses). These increases were partially offset by significantly lower expenses, including impairments, from CIEs (primarily in depreciation and amortization, occupancy and other expenses). Net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings were $121 million for the first nine months of 2025, compared with $168 million for the first nine months of 2024.As of September 2025, headcount increased by 4% compared with December 2024, primarily due to an increase in Asset & Wealth Management. In the first nine months of 2025, we recognized severance expense of approximately $170 million, which was largely in connection with a headcount reduction initiative in the second quarter of 2025. During the fourth quarter of 2025, we announced a multi-year initiative, OneGS 3.0, to transform our operating model. We expect that the new operating model will drive efficiencies and create capacity for future growth. We will constrain headcount growth through the end of 2025, in addition to a limited reduction in roles.Provision for Taxes The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2025 was 21.5%, down from the full year effective tax rate of 22.4% for 2024, primarily due to an increase in tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards, partially offset by a decrease in other permanent tax benefits, for the first nine months of 2025 compared with the full year of 2024. The increase compared with 20.2% for the first half of 2025 was primarily due to a decrease in the impact of tax benefits on the settlement of employee share-based awards. The impact of tax benefits related to employee share-based awards was a reduction to provision for taxes for the first nine months of 2025 of approximately $610 million, which reduced our effective tax rate by 3.8 percentage points, and increased our diluted EPS by $1.91 and annualized ROE by 0.7 percentage points.\nTEXT: Nine Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024.

The U.K. and other non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have enacted certain portions of the Pillar II Model Rules through domestic legislation (Pillar II legislation). In June 2025, the G7 nations issued a statement (G7 statement) under which U.S. parented multinationals, which are already subject to U.S. minimum tax rules, would be excluded from certain portions of the Pillar II Model Rules. However, it is expected that domestic minimum top-up taxes could still apply under the Pillar II legislation in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate. We expect additional guidance to be issued by the OECD/G20 regarding the G7 statement. These developments could impact any minimum tax we owe in 2025 or future periods; however, neither the Pillar II legislation nor the G7 statement are expected to have a material impact on our 2025 effective tax rate. Any domestic minimum top-up taxes under the Pillar II legislation will be recognized in the period in which they are incurred. In July 2025, H.R.1, referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), was signed into law. OBBBA permanently extends and modifies certain domestic and international provisions from 2017’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and phases out certain Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 incentives for investments in clean energy. Certain domestic provisions will have retroactive effects beginning in 2025, while the international provisions will generally be effective beginning in 2026. The OBBBA legislation is not expected to have a material impact on our 2025 effective tax rate and the impact on future periods will depend on any guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).We expect our 2025 annual effective tax rate to be approximately 22%.Segment Assets and Operating Results Segment Assets.

See Note 25 to the consolidated financial statements for net interest income by segment. •The primary driver of net revenues for FICC intermediation for all periods was client activity. •The increase in net interest income across FICC and Equities for the third quarter of 2025 compared with the third quarter of 2024 reflected a decrease in funding costs and an increase in interest-earning assets. Due to the nature of activities within FICC and Equities and the composition of their associated balance sheet, we assess the performance of these businesses based on total net revenues, as offsets can occur across revenue line items. For example, cash instruments that generate interest income are, in some cases, hedged or funded by derivatives for which changes in fair value are reflected in market making revenues. Also, certain activities produce market making revenues but incur interest expense related to the funding of the related inventory.The table below presents our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes.

Equity and equity-related and debt offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative of net revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or a change in the value of a transaction. •Equity and equity-related offerings includes Rule 144A and public common stock offerings, convertible offerings and rights offerings. •Debt offerings includes non-convertible preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities and taxable municipal debt. It also includes publicly registered and Rule 144A issues and excludes leveraged loans.Operating Environment. During the third quarter of 2025, Global Banking & Markets operated in an environment generally characterized by prolonged geopolitical stresses and continued broad macroeconomic concerns, including concerns and uncertainty about inflation, central bank policies and changes in international trade policies (including tariffs). In investment banking, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes and industry-wide equity underwriting volumes both increased compared with the second quarter of 2025, while industry-wide debt underwriting volumes were lower. In interest rates, the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds decreased, while the yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds increased during the quarter. In equities, the S&P 500 Index increased by 8% and the MSCI World Index increased by 7% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2025.In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate or the federal government shutdown in the U.S continues, and market-making activity levels decline further or investment banking activity levels decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in Global Banking & Markets would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted.\n"

During the third quarter of 2025, Global Banking & Markets operated in an environment generally characterized by prolonged geopolitical stresses and continued broad macroeconomic concerns, including concerns and uncertainty about inflation, central bank policies and changes in international trade policies (including tariffs). In investment banking, industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes and industry-wide equity underwriting volumes both increased compared with the second quarter of 2025, while industry-wide debt underwriting volumes were lower. In interest rates, the yield on 10-year U.S. government bonds decreased, while the yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds increased during the quarter. In equities, the S&P 500 Index increased by 8% and the MSCI World Index increased by 7% compared with the end of the second quarter of 2025.In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate or the federal government shutdown in the U.S continues, and market-making activity levels decline further or investment banking activity levels decline, or credit spreads related to hedges on our relationship lending portfolio tighten, net revenues in Global Banking & Markets would likely be negatively impacted. In addition, if economic conditions deteriorate or if the creditworthiness of borrowers deteriorates, provision for credit losses would likely be negatively impacted.\nTEXT: The table below presents our financial advisory and underwriting transaction volumes.\nTEXT: Three MonthsEnded SeptemberNine Months Ended September$ in billions2025202420252024Announced mergers and acquisitions$349 $228 $1,041 $734 Completed mergers and acquisitions$370 $198 $905 $701 Equity and equity-related offerings$15 $14 $50 $44 Debt offerings$64 $78 $246 $232\nTABLE: TABLE: Three MonthsEnded September Nine Months Ended September; $ in billions 2025 2024 2025 2024; Announced mergers and acquisitions $ 349 $ 228 $ 1,041 $ 734; Completed mergers and acquisitions $ 370 $ 198 $ 905 $ 701; Equity and equity-related offerings $ 15 $ 14 $ 50 $ 44; Debt offerings $ 64 $ 78 $ 246 $ 232.\nTITLE: $ in billions2025202420252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: Announced mergers and acquisitions$349 $228 $1,041 $734\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 349\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,041\nTITLE: Completed mergers and acquisitions$370 $198 $905 $701\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 370\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 905\nTITLE: Equity and equity-related offerings$15 $14 $50 $44\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 15\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 50\nTITLE: Debt offerings$64 $78 $246 $232\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 64\nTITLE: $\n"

Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $10.12 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 18% higher than the third quarter of 2024. Investment banking fees were $2.66 billion, 42% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant increase in completed mergers and acquisitions volumes, and in Debt underwriting, primarily driven by an increase in leveraged finance activity. Net revenues in Equity underwriting were higher, primarily driven by significantly higher net revenues from initial public offerings. As of September 2025, our Investment banking fees backlog was essentially unchanged compared with June 2025. Our backlog represents an estimate of our net revenues from future transactions where we believe that future revenue realization is more likely than not. We believe changes in our backlog may be a useful indicator of client activity levels which, over the long term, impact our net revenues. However, the time frame for completion and corresponding revenue recognition of transactions in our backlog varies based on the nature of the assignment, as certain transactions may remain in our backlog for longer periods of time. In addition, our backlog is subject to certain limitations, such as assumptions about the likelihood that individual client transactions will occur in the future. Transactions may be cancelled or modified, and transactions not included in the estimate may also occur. Net revenues in FICC were $3.47 billion, 17% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting significantly higher net revenues in FICC intermediation, due to significantly higher net revenues in interest rate products and higher net revenues in mortgages and commodities, partially offset by significantly lower net revenues in currencies and lower net revenues in credit products. Net revenues in FICC financing were higher, primarily driven by higher net revenues in mortgages and structured lending.The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory. The following provides information about our FICC intermediation net revenues by business, compared with results for the third quarter of 2024:•Net revenues in interest rate products and commodities reflected the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.•Net revenues in mortgages reflected higher client activity and the impact of improved market-making conditions on our inventory.•Net revenues in currencies and credit products reflected the impact of less favorable market-making conditions on our inventory.Net revenues in Equities were $3.74 billion, 7% higher than the third quarter of 2024, due to significantly higher net revenues in Equities financing, primarily driven by significantly higher net revenues in prime financing, partially offset by lower net revenues in Equities intermediation, driven by significantly lower net revenues in cash products.Net revenues in Other were $250 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $227 million for the third quarter of 2024.Provision for credit losses was $86 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $54 million for the third quarter of 2024. Provisions for the third quarter of 2025 reflected impairments and growth in the wholesale portfolio. Provisions for the third quarter of 2024 primarily reflected growth in the wholesale portfolio.Operating expenses were $5.73 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 15% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher transaction based expenses and higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance). Pre-tax earnings were $4.30 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 22% higher than the third quarter of 2024.Nine Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Net revenues in Global Banking & Markets were $30.94 billion for the first nine months of 2025, 17% higher than the first nine months of 2024. Investment banking fees were $6.76 billion, 19% higher than the first nine months of 2024, primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in Advisory, reflecting a significant increase in industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions volumes. Net revenues in Debt underwriting were higher, reflecting higher net revenues from investment-grade and asset-backed activity. Net revenues in Equity underwriting were also higher, driven by higher net revenues from initial public and convertible offerings, partially offset by lower net revenues from secondary offerings. As of September 2025, our Investment banking fees backlog was higher compared with December 2024, primarily due to significantly higher estimated net revenues from potential advisory transactions. Net revenues in FICC were $11.34 billion, 8% higher than the first nine months of 2024, due to higher net revenues in both FICC financing and FICC intermediation. The increase in FICC financing net revenues was primarily driven by higher net revenues in mortgages and structured lending. The increase in FICC intermediation net revenues reflected higher net revenues in interest rate products and currencies, partially offset by lower net revenues in commodities and mortgages and slightly lower net revenues in credit products.\n"

We receive fees related to managing assets for institutional and individual clients, providing investing and wealth advisory solutions, providing financial planning and counseling services, and executing brokerage transactions for wealth management clients. The vast majority of revenues in management and other fees consists of asset-based fees on client assets that we manage. For further information about assets under supervision, see “Assets Under Supervision” below. The fees that we charge vary by asset class, client channel and the types of services provided, and are affected by investment performance, as well as asset inflows and redemptions. •Incentive fees. In certain circumstances, we also receive incentive fees based on a percentage of a fund’s or a separately managed account’s return, or when the return exceeds a specified benchmark or other performance targets. Such fees include overrides, which consist of the increased share of the income and gains derived primarily from our private equity and credit funds when the return on a fund’s investments over the life of the fund exceeds certain threshold returns. •Private banking and lending. Our private banking and lending activities include issuing loans to our wealth management clients. Such loans are generally secured by commercial and residential real estate, securities or other assets. We also raise deposits from wealth management clients, including through Marcus. Private banking and lending revenues include net interest income allocated to deposits and net interest income earned on loans to individual clients. •Equity investments. Includes investing activities related to our asset management activities primarily related to public and private equity investments in corporate, real estate and infrastructure assets. We also make investments through CIEs, substantially all of which are engaged in real estate investment activities. In addition, we make investments in connection with our activities to satisfy requirements under the Community Reinvestment Act, primarily through our Urban Investment Group. •Debt investments. Includes lending activities related to our asset management activities, including investing in corporate debt, lending to middle-market clients, and providing financing for real estate and other assets.

Global equity prices were generally higher compared with the end of the second quarter of 2025, positively affecting assets under supervision.In the future, if market and economic conditions deteriorate, it may lead to a decline in asset prices, or investors transitioning to asset classes that typically generate lower fees or withdrawing their assets, and net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management would likely be negatively impacted. Three Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Net revenues in Asset & Wealth Management were $4.40 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 17% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting higher Management and other fees and significantly higher net revenues in Private banking and lending. The increase in Management and other fees primarily reflected the impact of higher average assets under supervision. The increase in Private banking and lending net revenues were primarily driven by the payment of interest on a previously impaired loan. Net revenues in Debt investments were higher, reflecting net mark-ups compared with net mark-downs in the prior year period, partially offset by lower net interest income due to a reduction in the debt investments balance sheet. Provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $33 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with a net benefit of $109 million for the third quarter of 2024. The net benefit for the third quarter of 2024 reflected a net benefit related to the wholesale portfolio (driven by recoveries on previously impaired loans and paydowns).Operating expenses were $3.30 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 16% higher than the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expenses (reflecting improved operating performance). Pre-tax earnings were $1.14 billion for the third quarter of 2025, 12% higher than the third quarter of 2024.\n"

The operating environment for Platform Solutions is mainly impacted by the economic environment in the U.S., which, during the third quarter of 2025, was generally characterized by concerns about inflation and uncertainty related to changes in international trade policies (including tariffs), a continued low rate of unemployment and improved pace of growth in consumer spending compared with the second quarter of 2025.In the future, if economic conditions deteriorate, it may lead to a decrease in consumer spending or a deterioration in consumer credit, and net revenues and provision for credit losses in Platform Solutions would likely be negatively impacted.Three Months Ended September 2025 versus September 2024. Net revenues in Platform Solutions were $670 million for the third quarter of 2025, 71% higher than the third quarter of 2024.Notwithstanding our strategic decision to narrow our focus on consumer-related activities, Consumer platforms net revenues were significantly higher compared with the third quarter of 2024, primarily reflecting a net loss in the prior year period related to the GM credit card program that was transferred to held for sale. Transaction banking and other net revenues were higher, primarily reflecting mark-downs in the prior year period related to the seller financing loan portfolio that was transferred to held for sale. See “Regulatory and Other Matters — Other Matters — Narrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related Activities” for further information. Provision for credit losses was $286 million for the third quarter of 2025, compared with $452 million for the third quarter of 2024. Provisions for both the third quarter of 2025 and the third quarter of 2024 reflected net charge-offs related to the credit card portfolio. Operating expenses were $423 million for the third quarter of 2025, 15% lower than the third quarter of 2024, reflecting the write-down of identifiable intangible assets related to the GM credit card program of $72 million in the prior year period.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTEXT: Balance Sheet and Funding Sources Balance Sheet Management One of our risk management disciplines is our ability to manage the size and composition of our balance sheet. While our asset base changes due to client activity, market fluctuations and business opportunities, the size and composition of our balance sheet also reflects factors, including (i) our overall risk tolerance, (ii) the amount of capital we hold and (iii) our funding profile, among other factors. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for information about our capital management process. Although our balance sheet fluctuates on a day-to-day basis, our total assets at quarter-end are generally not materially different from those occurring within our reporting periods.In order to ensure appropriate risk management, we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid balance sheet and have processes in place to dynamically manage our assets and liabilities, which include (i) balance sheet planning, (ii) setting balance sheet targets, (iii) monitoring of key metrics and (iv) scenario analyses. Balance Sheet Planning. We prepare a balance sheet plan that combines our projected total assets and composition of assets with our expected funding sources over a three-year time horizon. This plan is reviewed quarterly and may be adjusted in response to changing business needs or market conditions. The objectives of this planning process are: •To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements; •To allow Corporate Treasury to evaluate balance sheet targets of our revenue-producing units and requests to change such targets in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and •To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities. Corporate Treasury and Risk, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, target utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage. Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. See “Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our risk management structure. Setting Balance Sheet Targets. We set balance sheet targets with the aim of ensuring that our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the balance sheets for our businesses remain within our risk appetite. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee has the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet targets at least quarterly. Our balance sheet targets are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Risk. Requests for changes in targets are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with targets is monitored by our revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Risk. Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, target utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our recovery and resolution planning. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.\n"

The objectives of this planning process are:\nTEXT: •To develop our balance sheet projections, taking into account the general state of the financial markets and expected business activity levels, as well as regulatory requirements;\nTEXT: •To allow Corporate Treasury to evaluate balance sheet targets of our revenue-producing units and requests to change such targets in the context of our overall balance sheet constraints, including our liability profile and capital levels, and key metrics; and\nTEXT: •To inform the target amount, tenor and type of funding to raise, based on our projected assets and contractual maturities.\nTEXT: Corporate Treasury and Risk, along with our revenue-producing units, review current and prior period information and expectations for the year to prepare our balance sheet plan. The specific information reviewed includes asset and liability size and composition, target utilization, risk and performance measures, and capital usage.\nTEXT: Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. See “Risk Management — Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for an overview of our risk management structure. Setting Balance Sheet Targets. We set balance sheet targets with the aim of ensuring that our consolidated balance sheet, as well as the balance sheets for our businesses remain within our risk appetite. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee has the responsibility to review and approve balance sheet targets at least quarterly. Our balance sheet targets are set at levels which are close to actual operating levels, rather than at levels which reflect our maximum risk appetite, in order to ensure prompt escalation and discussion among our revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Risk. Requests for changes in targets are evaluated after giving consideration to their impact on our key metrics. Compliance with targets is monitored by our revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Risk. Monitoring of Key Metrics. We monitor key balance sheet metrics both by business and on a consolidated basis, including asset and liability size and composition, target utilization and risk measures. We attribute assets to businesses and review and analyze movements resulting from new business activity, as well as market fluctuations. Scenario Analyses. We conduct various scenario analyses, including as part of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Stress Tests (DFAST), as well as our recovery and resolution planning. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information about these scenario analyses. These scenarios cover short- and long-term time horizons using various macroeconomic and firm-specific assumptions, based on a range of economic scenarios. We use these analyses to assist us in developing our longer-term balance sheet management strategy, including the level and composition of assets, funding and capital. Additionally, these analyses help us develop approaches for maintaining appropriate funding, liquidity and capital across a variety of situations, including a severely stressed environment.\nTEXT: Our consolidated balance sheet plan, including our balance sheets by business, funding projections and projected key metrics, is reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee.

As of September 2025, the decrease in our repurchase agreements relative to the average daily amount of repurchase agreements during the quarter resulted from lower levels of our and our clients’ activities at the end of the period.The level of our repurchase agreements fluctuates between and within periods, primarily due to providing clients with access to highly liquid collateral, such as certain government and agency obligations, through collateralized financing activities.

We fund a significant amount of inventory and a portion of investments on a secured basis. Secured funding includes collateralized financings in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our collateralized financings, including its maturity profile. We may also pledge our inventory and investments as collateral for securities borrowed under a securities lending agreement. We also use our own inventory and investments to cover transactions in which we or our clients have sold securities that have not yet been purchased. Secured funding is less sensitive to changes in our credit quality than unsecured funding, due to our posting of collateral to our lenders. Nonetheless, we analyze the refinancing risk of our secured funding activities, taking into account trade tenors, maturity profiles, counterparty concentrations, collateral eligibility and counterparty rollover probabilities. We seek to mitigate our refinancing risk by executing term trades with staggered maturities, diversifying counterparties, raising excess secured funding and pre-funding residual risk through our GCLA. We seek to raise secured funding with a term appropriate for the liquidity of the assets that are being financed, and we seek longer maturities for secured funding collateralized by asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis, especially during times of market stress. Our secured funding, excluding funding collateralized by liquid government and agency obligations, is primarily executed for tenors of one month or greater and is primarily executed through term repurchase agreements and securities loaned contracts.Assets that may be harder to fund on a secured basis during times of market stress include certain financial instruments in the following categories: mortgage- and other asset-backed loans and securities, non-investment-grade corporate debt securities, equity securities and emerging market securities. We also raise financing through other types of collateralized financings, such as secured loans and notes. GS Bank USA has access to funding from the Federal Home Loan Bank. Our outstanding borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank were $5.04 billion as of both September 2025 and December 2024. Additionally, we have access to funding through the Federal Reserve discount window, but we do not rely on this funding in our liquidity planning and stress testing. Unsecured Short-Term Borrowings. A significant portion of our unsecured short-term borrowings was originally long-term debt that is scheduled to mature within one year of the reporting date. We use unsecured short-term borrowings, including U.S. and non-U.S. hybrid financial instruments and commercial paper, to finance liquid assets and for other cash management purposes. In accordance with regulatory requirements, Group Inc. does not issue debt with an original maturity of less than one year, other than to its subsidiaries. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our unsecured short-term borrowings. Unsecured Long-Term Borrowings. Unsecured long-term borrowings, including structured notes, are raised through syndicated U.S. registered offerings, U.S. registered and Rule 144A medium-term note programs, offshore medium-term note offerings and other debt offerings.

AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTEXT: THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTEXT: Capital Management and Regulatory Capital Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Capital Management We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting targets on our balance sheet and risk-weighted assets (RWAs), in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. We principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our subordinated debt and preferred stock. Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework. Our stress tests incorporate our internally designed stress scenarios, including our internally developed severely adverse scenario, and those required by the FRB, and are designed to capture our specific vulnerabilities and risks. We provide further information about our stress test processes and a summary of the results on our website as described in “Available Information.” As required by the FRB’s CCAR rules, we submit an annual capital plan for review by the FRB. The purpose of the FRB’s review is to ensure that we have a robust, forward-looking capital planning process that accounts for our unique risks and that permits continued operation during times of economic and financial stress. The FRB evaluates us based, in part, on whether we have the capital necessary to continue operating under the baseline and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and those developed internally. This evaluation also takes into account our process for identifying risk, our controls and governance for capital planning, and our guidelines for making capital planning decisions. In addition, the FRB evaluates our plan to make capital distributions (i.e., dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions of stock, subordinated debt or other capital securities) and issue capital, across the range of macroeconomic scenarios and firm-specific assumptions.

We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Capital Management We determine the appropriate amount and composition of our capital by considering multiple factors, including our current and future regulatory capital requirements, the results of our capital planning and stress testing process, the results of resolution capital models and other factors, such as rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment and conditions in the financial markets. We manage our capital requirements and the levels of our capital usage principally by setting targets on our balance sheet and risk-weighted assets (RWAs), in each case at both the firmwide and business levels. We principally manage the level and composition of our capital through issuances and repurchases of our common stock. We may issue, redeem or repurchase our preferred stock and subordinated debt or other forms of capital as business conditions warrant. Prior to such redemptions or repurchases, we must receive approval from the FRB. See Notes 14 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our subordinated debt and preferred stock. Capital Planning and Stress Testing Process. As part of capital planning, we project sources and uses of capital given a range of business environments, including stressed conditions. Our stress testing process is designed to identify and measure material risks associated with our business activities, including market risk, credit risk, operational risk and liquidity risk, as well as our ability to generate revenues. Our capital planning process incorporates an internal capital adequacy assessment with the objective of ensuring that we are appropriately capitalized relative to the risks in our businesses. We incorporate stress scenarios into our capital planning process with a goal of holding sufficient capital to ensure we remain adequately capitalized after experiencing a severe stress event. Our assessment of capital adequacy is viewed in tandem with our assessment of liquidity adequacy and is integrated into our overall risk management structure, governance and policy framework.\nTITLE: Capital Management and Regulatory Capital\nTEXT: Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us.

As part of our comprehensive capital management policy, we maintain a contingency capital plan. Our contingency capital plan provides a framework for analyzing and responding to a perceived or actual capital deficiency, including, but not limited to, identification of drivers of a capital deficiency, as well as mitigants and potential actions. It outlines the appropriate communication procedures to follow during a crisis period, including internal dissemination of information, as well as timely communication with external stakeholders. Capital Attribution. We assess the capital usage of each of our businesses based on our attributed equity framework. This framework considers many factors, including our internal assessment of risks, as well as the regulatory capital requirements related to our business activities.We review and make any necessary adjustments to our attributed equity in January each year, to reflect, among other things, our most recent stress test results and changes to our regulatory capital requirements. On January 1, 2025, our allocation of attributed equity changed (relative to the allocation as of December 2024) as follows: attributed equity increased by approximately $0.4 billion for Global Banking & Markets, while attributed equity decreased by approximately $0.3 billion for Asset & Wealth Management and approximately $0.1 billion for Platform Solutions. See “Results of Operations — Segment Assets and Operating Results — Segment Operating Results” for information about our average quarterly attributed equity by segment.Share Repurchase Program. We use our share repurchase program to help maintain the appropriate level of common equity. On an annual basis, we submit a Board of Directors of Group Inc. (Board) approved capital plan to the Federal Reserve, which includes planned share repurchases for each quarter. The share repurchases are effected primarily through regular open-market purchases (which may include repurchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 and accelerated share repurchases), the amounts and timing of which are determined primarily by our current and projected capital position, and capital deployment opportunities, but which may also be influenced by general market conditions and the prevailing price and trading volumes of our common stock. During the first quarter of 2025, the Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing repurchases of up to $40 billion of our common stock. The program has no set expiration or termination date. See “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” in Part II, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our share repurchase program, and see above for information about our capital planning and stress testing process.During the third quarter of 2025, we returned a total of $3.25 billion of capital to common shareholders, including $2.00 billion of common share repurchases and $1.25 billion of common stock dividends. The Board approved an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $3.00 to $4.00 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2025. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will continue prioritizing deployment of capital for our clients where returns are attractive and distribute any excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, while targeting a 50 to 100 basis point buffer above our capital requirement. We are subject to a one percent non-deductible federal excise tax (buyback tax) that is applicable to the fair market value of certain corporate share repurchases. The fair market value of share repurchases subject to the tax is reduced by the fair market value of any applicable stock issued during the calendar year, including stock issued to employees. The buyback tax did not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for either the three or nine months ended September 2025.Resolution Capital Models.

Market RWAs are calculated based on measures of exposure which include the following: •Value-at-Risk (VaR) is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level.For both risk management purposes and regulatory capital calculations, we use a single VaR model which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. However, VaR used for risk management purposes differs from VaR used for regulatory capital requirements (regulatory VaR) due to differences in time horizons, confidence levels and the scope of positions on which VaR is calculated. For risk management purposes, a 95% one-day VaR is used, whereas for regulatory capital requirements, a 99% 10-day VaR is used to determine Market RWAs and a 99% one-day VaR is used to determine regulatory VaR exceptions. In addition, the daily net revenues used to determine risk management VaR exceptions (i.e., comparing the daily net revenues to the VaR measure calculated as of the end of the prior business day) include intraday activity, whereas the Capital Framework requires that intraday activity be excluded from daily net revenues when calculating regulatory VaR exceptions. Intraday activity includes bid/offer net revenues, which are more likely than not to be positive by their nature. As a result, there may be differences in the number of VaR exceptions and the amount of daily net revenues calculated for regulatory VaR compared to the amounts calculated for risk management VaR. Our positional losses observed on a single day exceeded our 99% one-day regulatory VaR on two occasions during the nine months ended September 2025 and on two occasions during 2024. There was no change in our VaR multiplier used to calculate Market RWAs; •Stressed VaR is the potential loss in value of trading assets and liabilities, as well as certain investments, loans, and other financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value, during a period of significant market stress; •Incremental risk is the potential loss in value of non-securitized positions due to the default or credit migration of issuers of financial instruments over a one-year time horizon; •Comprehensive risk is the potential loss in value, due to price risk and defaults, within our credit correlation positions; and •Specific risk is the risk of loss on a position that could result from factors other than broad market movements, including event risk, default risk and idiosyncratic risk. The standardized measurement method is used to determine specific risk RWAs, by applying supervisory defined risk-weighting factors after applicable netting is performed.

U.S. Regulated Broker-Dealer Subsidiaries. GS&Co., our primary U.S. regulated broker-dealer subsidiary, is also a registered futures commission merchant and a registered swap dealer with the CFTC, and a registered security-based swap dealer with the SEC, and therefore is subject to regulatory capital requirements imposed by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., the CFTC, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the National Futures Association. Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC specify uniform minimum net capital requirements, as defined, for their registrants, and also effectively require that a significant part of the registrants’ assets be kept in relatively liquid form. GS&Co. has elected to calculate its SEC minimum capital requirements in accordance with the “Alternative Net Capital Requirement” as permitted by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC. GS&Co. had regulatory net capital, as defined by Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC, of $22.26 billion as of September 2025 and $21.31 billion as of December 2024, which exceeded the greater of the minimum amounts required under Rule 15c3-1 of the SEC and Rules 1.17 and Part 23 Subpart E of the CFTC by $16.28 billion as of September 2025 and $15.87 billion as of December 2024. In addition to its alternative minimum net capital requirements, GS&Co. is also required to hold tentative net capital in excess of $5 billion and net capital in excess of $1 billion in accordance with Rule 15c3-1. GS&Co. is also required to notify the SEC in the event that its tentative net capital is less than $6 billion. As of both September 2025 and December 2024, GS&Co. had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of both the minimum and the notification requirements.

Given that many of the new and proposed rules are highly complex, the full impact of regulatory reform will not be known until the rules are implemented and market practices develop under the final regulations. SCB Requirement. In April 2025, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) intended to reduce the volatility of the capital requirements resulting from the FRB’s annual stress tests. The NPR proposes to average the results of the supervisory stress tests from the two prior annual supervisory stress tests and extend the effective date of the SCB requirement from October 1 to January 1 for each year. If the rules are adopted as proposed, effective January 1, 2026, our SCB is estimated to be approximately 4.9% and our CET1 capital ratio requirement under the Standardized Capital Rules (including the G-SIB surcharge of 3.5%) is estimated to be approximately 12.9%. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about our SCB and “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Consolidated Regulatory Capital — G-SIB Surcharge” for further information about our G-SIB surcharge.Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) and TLAC Modifications. In July 2025, the FRB issued an NPR to recalibrate the enhanced SLR. The NPR proposes to replace the current 2% SLR buffer for G-SIBs with a buffer equal to 50% of their G-SIB surcharge (Method 1). This proposal would also make conforming modifications to the TLAC and external long-term debt requirements applicable to G-SIBs. The proposed rules, if adopted as proposed, could reduce each of our SLR, TLAC to total leverage exposure and external long-term debt to total leverage exposure ratio requirements by approximately 125 basis points.See “Business — Regulation” in Part I, Item 1 of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about the laws, rules and regulations and proposed laws, rules and regulations that apply to us and our operations.Other MattersNarrowing our Focus on Consumer-Related Activities.

Our involvement in these arrangements can take many different forms, including: •Purchasing or retaining residual and other interests in special purpose entities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securitization vehicles; •Holding senior and subordinated debt, interests in limited and general partnerships, and preferred and common stock in other nonconsolidated vehicles; •Entering into interest rate, foreign currency, equity, commodity and credit derivatives, including total return swaps; and •Providing guarantees, indemnifications, commitments, letters of credit and representations and warranties. We enter into these arrangements for a variety of business purposes, including securitizations. The securitization vehicles that purchase mortgages, corporate bonds and other types of financial assets are critical to the functioning of several significant investor markets, including the mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities markets, since they offer investors access to specific cash flows and risks created through the securitization process. We also enter into these arrangements to underwrite client securitization transactions; provide secondary market liquidity; make investments in performing and nonperforming debt, distressed loans, power-related assets, equity securities, real estate and other assets; and provide investors with credit-linked and asset-repackaged notes.

For further information about our risk management processes, see “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” and for information about our areas of risk, see “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management,” “Operational Risk Management,” “Cybersecurity Risk Management,” “Model Risk Management” and “Other Risk Management,” as well as “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K.Overview and Structure of Risk Management Overview Effective risk management is critical to our success. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management framework that employs a comprehensive, integrated approach to risk management and is designed to enable comprehensive risk management processes through which we identify, assess, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our activities. Our risk management structure is built around three core components: governance, processes and people. Governance. Risk management governance starts with the Board, which both directly and through its committees, including its Risk Committee, oversees our approach to managing our risks through the enterprise risk management framework. The Board is also responsible for the annual review and approval of our risk appetite statement. The risk appetite statement describes the levels and types of risk we are willing to accept or to avoid in order to achieve our objectives included in our strategy and business plan, while remaining in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Board reviews our strategy and business plan and is ultimately responsible for overseeing and providing direction about our strategy and risk appetite. The Board, including through its committees, receives regular briefings on firmwide risks, including liquidity risk, market risk, credit risk, operational risk, model risk and climate risk, from our chief risk officer, on cybersecurity threats and risks from our chief information security officer (CISO), on compliance risk and conduct risk from our chief compliance officer, on legal and regulatory enforcement matters from our chief legal officer, and on other matters impacting our reputation from the chair and/or vice-chairs of our Firmwide Reputational Risk Committee. The chief risk officer reports to our chief executive officer and to the Risk Committee of the Board. As part of the review of the firmwide risk portfolio, the chief risk officer regularly advises the Risk Committee of the Board of relevant risk metrics and material exposures, including risk limits and thresholds established in our risk appetite statement. Enterprise Risk, which reports to our chief risk officer, is responsible for ensuring that our enterprise risk management framework provides the Board, our risk committees and senior management with a consistent and integrated approach to managing our various risks in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. Our first line of defense consists of our revenue-producing units, Conflicts Resolution, Controllers, Engineering, Corporate Treasury and certain other corporate functions. The first line of defense is responsible for its risk-generating activities, as well as for the design and execution of controls to mitigate such risks. Our Risk and Compliance functions are considered our second line of defense and provide independent assessment, oversight and challenge of the risks taken by our first line of defense, as well as lead and participate in firmwide risk committees. Internal Audit is considered our third line of defense, and our director of Internal Audit reports to the Audit Committee of the Board and administratively to our chief executive officer. Internal Audit includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. Internal Audit is responsible for independently assessing and validating the effectiveness of key controls, including those within the risk management framework, and providing timely reporting to the Audit Committee of the Board, senior management and regulators. The three lines of defense structure promotes the accountability of first line risk takers, provides a framework for effective challenge by the second line and empowers independent review from the third line.\n"

We maintain various processes that are critical components of our risk management framework, including (i) risk identification and assessment, (ii) risk appetite, limits, thresholds and alerts, (iii) control monitoring and testing, and (iv) risk reporting. •Risk Identification and Assessment. We believe the identification and assessment of our risks is a critical step in providing our Board and senior management transparency and insight into the range and materiality of our risks. We have a comprehensive data collection process, including firmwide policies and procedures that require all employees to report and escalate risk events. Our approach for risk identification and assessment is comprehensive across all risk types, is dynamic and forward-looking to reflect and adapt to our changing risk profile and business environment, leverages subject matter expertise, and allows for prioritization of our most critical risks. We perform risk assessments periodically with the aim of ensuring that our material financial and nonfinancial risks are mitigated through controls to an acceptable tolerance level in accordance with our risk appetite. Our risk assessments include, among other things, the use of stress testing, as well as an assessment of our internal control processes designed to mitigate such risks.Firmwide stress testing is an important part of our risk management process. It allows us to quantify our exposure to tail risks, highlight potential loss concentrations, undertake risk/reward analysis, and assess and mitigate our risk positions. Firmwide stress tests are performed on a regular basis and are designed to ensure a comprehensive analysis of our vulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks combining financial and nonfinancial risks, including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity and funding, operational and compliance, strategic, systemic and emerging risks into our stress scenarios. We also perform ad hoc stress tests in anticipation of market events or conditions. Stress tests are also used to assess capital adequacy as part of our capital planning and stress testing process. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital — Capital Management” for further information. We maintain a daily discipline of marking substantially all of our inventory to current market levels. We carry our inventory at fair value, with changes in valuation reflected immediately in our risk management systems and in net revenues. We do so because we believe this discipline is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk and that it provides transparent and realistic insight into our inventory exposures. •Risk Appetite, Limits, Thresholds and Alerts. We apply risk limits, thresholds and alerts to control and monitor risk across transactions, products, businesses and markets. The Board, directly or indirectly through its Risk Committee, approves limits, thresholds and alerts included in our risk appetite statement at firmwide, business and product levels. In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits, thresholds and alerts policy, subject to the overall limits directly or indirectly approved by the Board, and monitoring these limits. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving and monitoring limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee also authorizes Risk to set limits and thresholds to support monitoring and oversight at a more granular level. For example, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changes to our strategic business plan, as well as changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. Risks limits are monitored by the respective Risk functions.\n"

In addition, the Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee, through delegated authority from the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee, is responsible for approving our risk limits, thresholds and alerts policy, subject to the overall limits directly or indirectly approved by the Board, and monitoring these limits.\nTEXT: The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee is responsible for approving and monitoring limits at firmwide, business and product levels. Certain limits may be set at levels that will require periodic adjustment, rather than at levels that reflect our maximum risk appetite. This fosters an ongoing dialogue about risk among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management, as well as rapid escalation of risk-related matters. The Firmwide Risk Appetite Committee also authorizes Risk to set limits and thresholds to support monitoring and oversight at a more granular level. For example, Market Risk sets limits at certain product and desk levels, and Credit Risk sets limits for individual counterparties and their subsidiaries, industries and countries. Limits are reviewed regularly and amended on a permanent or temporary basis to reflect changes to our strategic business plan, as well as changing market conditions, business conditions or risk tolerance. Risks limits are monitored by the respective Risk functions.\nTEXT: Goldman Sachs September 2025 Form 10-Q140\nTEXT: Goldman Sachs September 2025 Form 10-Q\nTITLE: THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

We perform control monitoring and testing to measure the effectiveness of our key controls and to ensure that we are in compliance with policies, codes of conduct, control standards and regulatory requirements. Monitoring and testing is performed by dedicated teams within the first and second lines of defense. These teams establish procedures, develop risk-based annual plans, perform control testing and escalate identified issues.Issues identified by the dedicated teams, as well as self-identified issues by our employees, are assessed for appropriate escalation and resolution. Where material or thematic issues exist, we develop a plan to remediate them, as appropriate, and monitor the remediation activities. •Risk Reporting. Effective risk reporting depends on our ability to get the right information to the right people at the right time. Risk reporting is designed to be both forward- and backward-looking and consider detailed information on existing and emerging risk exposures. Risk reporting may include stress testing and scenario analysis, information about the risk profiles for financial and nonfinancial risks, utilization of risk limits and thresholds, details of new and emerging risks identified through our risk identification processes, details of issues, significant internal and external events, and information related to the effectiveness of our controls and remediation plans. As such, we focus on the rigor and effectiveness of our risk systems, with the objective of ensuring that our risk management technology systems provide us with complete, accurate and timely information. Our risk reporting process is designed to take into account information about both existing and emerging risks, thereby enabling our risk committees and senior management to perform their responsibilities with the appropriate level of insight into risk exposures.We make extensive use of risk committees and councils that meet regularly and serve as an important means to facilitate and foster ongoing discussions to manage and mitigate risks. We maintain strong and proactive communication about risk and we have a culture of collaboration in decision-making among our first and second lines of defense, committees and senior management.

Our training and development programs, including certain sessions led by our most senior leaders, are focused on the importance of risk management, client relationships and reputational excellence. As part of our performance review process, we assess reputational excellence, including how an employee exercises good risk management and reputational judgment, and adheres to our code of conduct and compliance policies.

Our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core businesses to continue to serve clients and generate revenues, even under adverse circumstances. Corporate Treasury is responsible for our liquidity, including developing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy. Liquidity Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our liquidity risk by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses. Liquidity Risk is also responsible for the establishment of stress testing and limits frameworks.\nTEXT: •Firmwide Data Governance Committee. The Firmwide Data Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the firmwide data governance framework, and its implementation, to help ensure that data governance and data quality are appropriate. This committee is co-chaired by our chief information officer and the chairman of Risk, who are appointed as chairs by the chairs of the Firmwide Enterprise Risk Committee.\nTEXT: Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. The Firmwide Asset Liability Committee is responsible for the strategic direction of our financial resources, including capital, liquidity, funding and balance sheet. This committee has oversight responsibility for asset liability management, including interest rate and currency risk, funds transfer pricing, capital allocation and incentives, and credit ratings. This committee is co-chaired by our chief financial officer and our global treasurer, who are appointed as chairs by our chief executive officer, and reports to the Management Committee.\nTITLE: Liquidity Risk Management\nTITLE: Overview\nTEXT: Liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity needs in the event of firm-specific, broader industry or market liquidity stress events.

GCLA. GCLA is liquidity that we maintain to meet a broad range of potential cash outflows and collateral needs in a stressed environment. A primary liquidity principle is to pre-fund our estimated potential cash and collateral needs during a liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered, highly liquid securities and cash. We believe that the securities held in our GCLA would be readily convertible to cash in a matter of days, through liquidation, by entering into repurchase agreements or from maturities of resale agreements, and that this cash would allow us to meet immediate obligations without needing to sell other assets or depend on additional funding from credit-sensitive markets. Our GCLA reflects the following principles: •The first days or weeks of a liquidity crisis are the most critical to a company’s survival; •Focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflows, not just disruptions to financing flows. Our businesses are diverse, and our liquidity needs are determined by many factors, including market movements, collateral requirements and client commitments, all of which can change dramatically in a difficult funding environment; •During a liquidity crisis, credit-sensitive funding, including unsecured debt, certain deposits and some types of secured financing agreements, may be unavailable, and the terms (e.g., interest rates, collateral provisions and tenor) or availability of other types of secured financing may change and certain deposits may be withdrawn; and •As a result of our policy to pre-fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in a crisis, we hold more unencumbered securities and have larger funding balances than our businesses would otherwise require. We believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balances of highly liquid unencumbered securities, even though it increases our total assets and our funding costs. We maintain our GCLA across Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Funding LLC (Funding IHC) and Group Inc.’s major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries, asset types and clearing agents with the goal of providing us with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major markets, even in a difficult funding environment. In addition to the GCLA, we maintain cash balances and securities in several of our other entities, primarily for use in specific currencies, entities or jurisdictions where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity. Asset-Liability Management. Our liquidity risk management policies are designed to ensure we have a sufficient amount of financing, even when funding markets experience persistent stress. We manage the maturities and diversity of our funding across markets, products and counterparties, and seek to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. Our approach to asset-liability management includes: •Conservatively managing the overall characteristics of our funding book, with a focus on maintaining long-term, diversified sources of funding in excess of our current requirements. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources — Funding Sources” for further information; •Actively managing and monitoring our asset base, with particular focus on the liquidity, holding period and ability to fund assets on a secured basis. We assess our funding requirements and our ability to liquidate assets in a stressed environment while appropriately managing risk. This enables us to determine the most appropriate funding products and tenors. See “Balance Sheet and Funding Sources — Balance Sheet Management” for further information about our balance sheet management process and “— Funding Sources — Secured Funding” for further information about asset classes that may be harder to fund on a secured basis; and •Raising secured and unsecured financing that has a long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our assets. This reduces the risk that our liabilities will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our assets. Because we maintain a highly liquid balance sheet, the holding period of certain of our assets may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity dates. Our goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our assets and meet our contractual and contingent obligations in normal times, as well as during periods of market stress. Through our dynamic balance sheet management process, we use actual and projected asset balances to determine secured and unsecured funding requirements. Funding plans are reviewed and approved by the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee. In addition, Risk and the Firmwide Asset Liability Committee review our total unsecured long-term borrowings and total shareholders’ equity to help ensure that we maintain a level of long-term funding that is sufficient to meet our long-term financing requirements. In a liquidity crisis, we would begin by liquidating and monetizing our GCLA before selling other assets. However, we recognize that orderly asset sales may be prudent or necessary in a severe or persistent liquidity crisis.\n"

In addition, Group Inc. provides its regulated subsidiaries with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirements. The benefits of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirements of our subsidiaries. Funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through a variety of products, including deposits, secured funding and unsecured borrowings. Our intercompany funding policies assume that a subsidiary’s funds or securities are not freely available to its parent, Funding IHC or other subsidiaries unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In particular, many of our subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds from those subsidiaries to Group Inc. or Funding IHC. Regulatory action of that kind could impede access to funds that Group Inc. needs to make payments on its obligations. Accordingly, we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or other subsidiaries and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiaries is not available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC until the maturity of such financing. Group Inc. has provided substantial amounts of equity and subordinated indebtedness, directly or indirectly, to its regulated subsidiaries. For example, as of September 2025, Group Inc. had $40.15 billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in GS&Co., its principal U.S. registered broker-dealer; $49.58 billion invested in GSI, a regulated U.K. broker-dealer; $2.29 billion invested in GSJCL, a regulated Japanese broker-dealer; $65.33 billion invested in GS Bank USA, a regulated New York State-chartered bank; and $5.79 billion invested in GSIB, a regulated U.K. bank. Group Inc. also provides financing, directly or indirectly, in the form of: $153.96 billion of unsubordinated loans (including secured loans of $56.30 billion) and $29.81 billion of collateral and cash deposits to these entities as of September 2025. In addition, as of September 2025, Group Inc. had significant amounts of capital invested in and loans to its other regulated subsidiaries. Contingency Funding Plan. We maintain a contingency funding plan to provide a framework for analyzing and responding to a liquidity crisis situation or periods of market stress. Our contingency funding plan outlines a list of potential risk factors, key reports and metrics that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of, and managing through, a liquidity crisis and/or market dislocation. The contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential responses if our assessments indicate that we have entered a liquidity crisis, which include pre-funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral needs, as well as utilizing secondary sources of liquidity. Mitigants and action items to address specific risks which may arise are also described and assigned to individuals responsible for execution. The contingency funding plan identifies key groups of individuals and their responsibilities, which include fostering effective coordination, control and distribution of information, implementing liquidity maintenance activities and managing internal and external communication, all of which are critical in the management of a crisis or period of market stress. Stress Tests In order to determine the appropriate size of our GCLA, we model liquidity outflows over a range of scenarios and time horizons. One of our primary internal liquidity risk models, referred to as the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, quantifies our liquidity risks over a 30-day stress scenario. We also consider other factors, including, but not limited to, an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity needs through an additional internal liquidity risk model, referred to as the Intraday Liquidity Model, the results of our long-term stress testing models, our resolution liquidity models and other applicable regulatory requirements and a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets. The results of the Modeled Liquidity Outflow, the Intraday Liquidity Model, the long-term stress testing models and the resolution liquidity models are reported to senior management on a regular basis. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\n"

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: •Severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and •A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage (including, as a result of, the dissemination of negative information through social media), litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: •Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; •A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; •Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; •No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and •A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements. Intraday Liquidity Model. Our Intraday Liquidity Model measures our intraday liquidity needs in a scenario where access to sources of intraday liquidity may become constrained. The intraday liquidity model considers a variety of factors, including historical settlement activity. Long-Term Stress Testing. We utilize longer-term stress tests to take a forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress periods in which we experience a severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging. We are focused on ensuring conservative asset-liability management to prepare for a prolonged period of potential stress, seeking to maintain a diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor, taking into consideration the characteristics and liquidity profile of our assets. Resolution Liquidity Models. In connection with our resolution planning efforts, we have established our Resolution Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning framework, which estimates liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries in a stressed environment. The liquidity needs are measured using our Modeled Liquidity Outflow assumptions and include certain additional inter-affiliate exposures. We have also established our Resolution Liquidity Execution Need framework, which measures the liquidity needs of our major subsidiaries to stabilize and wind down following a Group Inc. bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy. In addition, we have established a triggers and alerts framework, which is designed to provide the Board with information needed to make an informed decision on whether and when to commence bankruptcy proceedings for Group Inc. Limits We use liquidity risk limits at various levels and across liquidity risk types to manage the size of our liquidity exposures. Limits are measured relative to acceptable levels of risk given our liquidity risk tolerance. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process. Limits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Liquidity Risk. Liquidity Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. GCLA and Unencumbered Metrics GCLA. Based on the results of our internal liquidity risk models, described above, as well as our consideration of other factors, including, but not limited to, a qualitative assessment of our condition, as well as the financial markets, we believe our liquidity position as of both September 2025 and December 2024 was appropriate. We strictly limit our GCLA to a narrowly defined list of securities and cash because they are highly liquid, even in a difficult funding environment. We do not include other potential sources of excess liquidity in our GCLA, such as less liquid unencumbered securities or committed credit facilities.\n"

Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow is based on conducting multiple scenarios that include combinations of market-wide and firm-specific stress. These scenarios are characterized by the following qualitative elements: •Severely challenged market environments, which include low consumer and corporate confidence, financial and political instability, and adverse changes in market values, including potential declines in equity markets and widening of credit spreads; and •A firm-specific crisis potentially triggered by material losses, reputational damage (including, as a result of, the dissemination of negative information through social media), litigation and/or a ratings downgrade. The following are key modeling elements of our Modeled Liquidity Outflow: •Liquidity needs over a 30-day scenario; •A two-notch downgrade of our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings; •Changing conditions in funding markets, which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding; •No support from additional government funding facilities. Although we have access to various central bank funding programs, we do not assume reliance on additional sources of funding in a liquidity crisis; and •A combination of contractual outflows and contingent outflows arising from both our on- and off-balance sheet arrangements. Contractual outflows include, among other things, upcoming maturities of unsecured debt, term deposits and secured funding. Contingent outflows include, among other things, the withdrawal of customer credit balances in our prime brokerage business, increase in variation margin requirements due to adverse changes in the value of our exchange-traded and OTC-cleared derivatives, draws on unfunded commitments and withdrawals of deposits that have no contractual maturity. See notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about contractual outflows, including Note 11 for collateralized financings, Note 13 for deposits, Note 14 for unsecured long-term borrowings and Note 15 for operating lease payments, and “Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements” for further information about our various types of off-balance sheet arrangements.

We maintain our GCLA to enable us to meet current and potential liquidity requirements of our parent company, Group Inc., and its subsidiaries. Our Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model incorporate a requirement for Group Inc., as well as a standalone requirement for each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries. Funding IHC is required to provide the necessary liquidity to Group Inc. during the ordinary course of business, and is also obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to major subsidiaries in the event of our material financial distress or failure. Liquidity held directly in each of our major broker-dealer and bank subsidiaries is intended for use only by that subsidiary to meet its liquidity requirements and is assumed not to be available to Group Inc. or Funding IHC unless (i) legally provided for and (ii) there are no additional regulatory, tax or other restrictions. In addition, the Modeled Liquidity Outflow and Intraday Liquidity Model also incorporate a broader assessment of standalone liquidity requirements for other subsidiaries and we hold a portion of our GCLA directly at Group Inc. or Funding IHC to support such requirements. Other Unencumbered Assets. In addition to our GCLA, we have a significant amount of other unencumbered cash and financial instruments, including other government obligations, high-grade money market securities, corporate obligations, marginable equities, loans and cash deposits not included in our GCLA. The fair value of our unencumbered assets averaged $329.19 billion for the three months ended September 2025 and $326.00 billion for the three months ended June 2025. We do not consider these assets liquid enough to be eligible for our GCLA. Liquidity Regulatory Framework We are subject to a minimum Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) under the LCR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The LCR rule requires organizations to maintain an adequate ratio of eligible high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) to expected net cash outflows under an acute, short-term liquidity stress scenario. Eligible HQLA excludes HQLA held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100%. We expect that fluctuations in client activity, business mix and the market environment will impact our LCR. The table below presents information about our average daily LCR.

We are also subject to a minimum Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) under the NSFR rule approved by the U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies. The NSFR rule requires large U.S. banking organizations to maintain available stable funding (ASF) above their required stable funding (RSF) over a one-year time horizon. Total ASF excludes ASF held by subsidiaries that is in excess of their minimum requirement and is subject to transfer restrictions. We are required to maintain a minimum NSFR of 100%.

The NSFR requirement described above also applies to GS Bank USA. As of September 2025, GS Bank USA’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. •GSI and GSIB. GSI and GSIB are subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the U.K. regulatory authorities. GSI’s and GSIB’s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 2025 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSI and GSIB are subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the U.K. As of September 2025, both GSI’s and GSIB’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. •GSBE. GSBE is subject to a minimum LCR of 100% under the LCR rule approved by the European Parliament and Council. GSBE’s average monthly LCR for the trailing twelve-month period ended September 2025 exceeded the minimum requirement. GSBE is subject to the applicable NSFR requirement in the E.U. As of September 2025, GSBE’s NSFR exceeded the minimum requirement. •Other Subsidiaries. We monitor local regulatory liquidity requirements of our subsidiaries to ensure compliance. For many of our subsidiaries, these requirements either have changed or are likely to change in the future due to the implementation of the Basel Committee’s framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, as well as other regulatory developments. The implementation of these rules and any amendments adopted by the regulatory authorities could impact our liquidity and funding requirements and practices in the future. Credit Ratings We rely on the short- and long-term debt capital markets to fund a significant portion of our day-to-day operations, and the cost and availability of debt financing is influenced by our credit ratings. Credit ratings are also important when we are competing in certain markets, such as OTC derivatives, and when we seek to engage in longer-term transactions. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K for information about the risks associated with a reduction in our credit ratings.

AND SUBSIDIARIESManagement’s Discussion and Analysis\nTEXT: THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTEXT: We believe our credit ratings are primarily based on the credit rating agencies’ assessment of: •Our liquidity, market, credit and operational risk management practices;•Our level and variability of earnings;•Our capital base; •Our franchise, reputation and management; •Our corporate governance; and •The external operating and economic environment, including, in some cases, the assumed level of government support or other systemic considerations, such as potential resolution. Certain of our derivatives have been transacted under bilateral agreements with counterparties who may require us to post collateral or terminate the transactions based on changes in our credit ratings. We manage our GCLA to ensure we would, among other potential requirements, be able to make the additional collateral or termination payments that may be required in the event of a two-notch reduction in our long-term credit ratings, as well as collateral that has not been called by counterparties, but is available to them. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives with credit-related contingent features and the additional collateral or termination payments related to our net derivative liabilities under bilateral agreements that could have been called by counterparties in the event of a one- or two-notch downgrade in our credit ratings. Cash Flows As a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and bear little relation to our net earnings and net assets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analysis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the liquidity and asset-liability management policies described above. Cash flow analysis may, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends and strategic initiatives in our businesses. Nine Months Ended September 2025. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $12.52 billion to $169.58 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2025, due to net cash used for investing and operating activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities and the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected an increase in net lending activities (reflecting increases in other collateralized lending and real estate loans) and net purchases of U.S. government obligations accounted for as available-for-sale securities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected cash outflows from trading assets and collateralized transactions (reflecting a decrease in collateralized financings, partially offset by a decrease in collateralized agreements), partially offset by cash inflows from trading liabilities and net earnings. The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from deposits (reflecting increases in other deposit and consumer deposit balances) and net issuances of unsecured long-term borrowings, partially offset by common stock repurchases. The increase in cash and cash equivalents, as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates, was due to the U.S. dollar weakening during the nine months ended September 2025.Nine Months Ended September 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased by $86.89 billion to $154.69 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024, primarily due to net cash used for operating and investing activities, partially offset by net cash provided by financing activities. The net cash used for operating activities primarily reflected cash outflows from trading assets, partially offset by cash inflows from collateralized transactions (reflecting a decrease in collateralized agreements and an increase in collateralized financings), trading liabilities and net earnings. The net cash used for investing activities primarily reflected net purchases of investments (primarily U.S. government and agency obligations accounted for as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities). The net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflected cash inflows from deposits (reflecting an increase in consumer deposits, partially offset by a decrease in transaction banking deposits) and cash inflows from other secured financings, partially offset by net repayments of unsecured long-term borrowings.\n"

Our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: •Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;•Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; •Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and •Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. Market Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses. Managers in revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis. Managers in revenue-producing units and Corporate Treasury are accountable for managing risk within prescribed limits. These managers have in-depth knowledge of their positions, markets and the instruments available to hedge their exposures. Market Risk Management Process Our process for managing market risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following: •Monitoring compliance with established market risk limits and reporting our exposures; •Diversifying exposures; •Controlling position sizes; and •Evaluating mitigants, such as economic hedges in related securities or derivatives. Our market risk management systems enable us to perform an independent calculation of VaR, Earnings-at-Risk (EaR) and other stress measures, capture risk measures at individual position levels, attribute risk measures to individual risk factors of each position, report many different views of the risk measures (e.g., by desk, business, product type or entity) and produce ad hoc analyses in a timely manner. Risk Measures We produce risk measures and monitor them against established market risk limits. These measures reflect an extensive range of scenarios and the results are aggregated at product, business and firmwide levels. We use a variety of risk measures to estimate the size of potential losses for small, moderate and more extreme market moves over both short- and long-term time horizons. Our primary risk measures are VaR, EaR and other stress tests. Our risk reports detail key risks, drivers and changes for each desk and business, and are distributed daily to senior management of both our revenue-producing units and Risk. Value-at-Risk. VaR is the potential loss in value due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level. For assets and liabilities included in VaR, see “Financial Statement Linkages to Market Risk Measures.” We typically employ a one-day time horizon with a 95% confidence level. We use a single VaR model, which captures risks, including those related to interest rates, equity prices, currency rates and commodity prices. As such, VaR facilitates comparison across portfolios of different risk characteristics. VaR also captures the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level.\nTEXT: Market Risk Management Overview Market risk is the risk of an adverse impact to our earnings due to changes in market conditions. Our assets and liabilities that give rise to market risk primarily include positions held for market making for our clients and for our investing and financing activities, and these positions change based on client demands and our investment opportunities. We employ a variety of risk measures, each described in the respective sections below, to monitor market risk. Categories of market risk include the following: •Interest rate risk: results from exposures to changes in the level, slope and curvature of yield curves, the volatilities of interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit spreads;•Equity price risk: results from exposures to changes in prices and volatilities of individual equities, baskets of equities and equity indices; •Currency rate risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates; and •Commodity price risk: results from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of commodities, such as crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity, and precious and base metals. Market Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our market risk by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses. Managers in revenue-producing units, Corporate Treasury and Market Risk discuss market information, positions and estimated loss scenarios on an ongoing basis.

Inherent limitations to VaR include: •VaR does not estimate potential losses over longer time horizons where moves may be extreme; •VaR does not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk positions; and •Previous moves in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of all future market moves. To comprehensively capture our exposures and relevant risks in our VaR calculation, we use historical simulations with full valuation of market factors at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factors for that position. These market factors include spot prices, credit spreads, funding spreads, yield curves, volatility and correlation, and are updated periodically based on changes in the composition of positions, as well as variations in market conditions. We sample from five years of historical data to generate the scenarios for our VaR calculation. The historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time. This gives greater importance to more recent observations and reflects current asset volatilities, which improves the accuracy of our estimates of potential loss. As a result, even if our positions included in VaR were unchanged, our VaR would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa. Given its reliance on historical data, VaR is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions. Our VaR measure does not include: •Positions that are not accounted for at fair value, such as held-to-maturity securities and loans, deposits and unsecured borrowings that are accounted for at amortized cost;•Available-for-sale securities for which the related unrealized fair value gains and losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss);•Positions that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measures; and •The impact of changes in counterparty and our own credit spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. We perform daily backtesting of our VaR model (i.e., comparing daily net revenues for positions included in VaR to the VaR measure calculated as of the prior business day) at the firmwide level and for each of our businesses and major regulated subsidiaries. Earnings-at-Risk. We manage our interest rate risk using the EaR metric. EaR measures the estimated impact of changes in interest rates to our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over a defined time horizon. EaR complements the VaR metric, which measures the impact of interest rate changes that have an immediate impact on the fair values of our assets and liabilities (i.e., mark-to-market changes). Our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:•Differences in maturity or repricing dates of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments.•Differences in the amounts of assets, liabilities, preferred stock and certain off-balance sheet instruments with the same maturity or repricing dates. •Certain interest rate sensitive fees.Corporate Treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all businesses using both cash and derivative instruments, including available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities and interest rate derivatives. We measure EaR over a one-year time horizon, including a 100- and 200-basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short- and long-term interest rates. This sensitivity is calculated relative to a baseline market scenario, which takes into consideration, among other things, the market’s expectation of forward rates, as well as our expectation of future business activity. These scenarios include contractual elements of assets, liabilities, preferred stock, and certain off-balance sheet instruments, such as rates of interest, principal repayment schedules, maturity and reset dates, and any interest rate ceilings or floors, as well as assumptions with respect to our balance sheet size and composition, prepayment behavior and deposit repricing. Deposit repricing is captured by evaluating the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in market rates (deposit beta) and we calibrate the deposit betas used in our models by using a number of factors, including observed historical behavior, future expectations, funding needs and the competitive landscape. We continuously monitor the performance of our key assumptions against observed behavior and regularly review their sensitivity on our risk metrics. We manage EaR with a goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from changes in interest rates so it remains within our EaR risk appetite. Our EaR scenario is regularly evaluated and updated, if necessary, to reflect changes in our business plans, market conditions and other macroeconomic factors. While management uses the best information available to estimate EaR, actual results may differ materially as a result of, among other things, changes in the economic environment or assumptions used in the process. We also measure the sensitivity of the economic value of our equity (EVE) to changes in interest rates. Compared to EaR, EVE provides a longer-term measurement of the interest rate risk exposure, primarily on non-trading assets and liabilities, by capturing the net impact of changes in interest rates to the present value of their cash flows.\n"

Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our interest rate risk (including EaR and EVE sensitivity) by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses. Stress Testing. Stress testing is a method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenarios. We use stress tests to examine risks of specific portfolios, as well as the potential impact of our significant risk exposures. We use a variety of stress testing techniques to calculate the potential loss from a wide range of market moves on our portfolios, including firmwide stress tests, sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis. The results of our various stress tests are analyzed together for risk management purposes. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests. Sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of a market move in a single risk factor across all positions (e.g., equity prices or credit spreads) using a variety of defined market shocks, ranging from those that could be expected over a one-day time horizon up to those that could take many months to occur. We also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity, which captures the risk of large or concentrated exposures. Scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of a specified event, including how the event impacts multiple risk factors simultaneously. For example, for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign positions, as well as the corresponding debt, equity and currency exposures associated with our non-sovereign positions that may be impacted by the sovereign distress. When conducting scenario analysis, we often consider a number of possible outcomes for each scenario, ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impacts. In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios. Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so). Limits We use market risk limits at various levels to manage the size of our market exposures. These limits are set based on VaR, EaR and on a range of stress tests relevant to our exposures. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process. Limits are monitored by Corporate Treasury and Risk. Risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded (e.g., due to positional changes or changes in market conditions, such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations). Such instances are remediated by a reduction in the positions we hold and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the limit, if warranted. Metrics We analyze VaR at the firmwide level and a variety of more detailed levels, including by risk category, business and region. Diversification effect in the tables below represents the difference between total VaR and the sum of the VaR for the four risk categories. This effect arises because the four market risk categories are not perfectly correlated. Substantially all positions in VaR are included within Global Banking & Markets.The table below presents our average daily VaR.

In addition, these stress tests are constructed using both historical events and forward-looking hypothetical scenarios.\nTEXT: Unlike VaR measures, which have an implied probability because they are calculated at a specified confidence level, there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenarios will occur. Instead, stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme moves in underlying market factors. When estimating potential loss, we generally assume that our positions cannot be reduced or hedged (although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so).\n"

Substantially all such equity positions are included within Asset & Wealth Management.•Debt positions include mezzanine and senior debt, and corporate and real estate loans, substantially all of which are included within Asset & Wealth Management. Debt positions also included approximately $1.6 billion as of June 2025 and approximately $1.7 billion as of September 2024 of GM co-branded credit card loans within Platform Solutions that were classified as held for sale.

See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about investments, Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about loans and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about derivatives. •These measures do not reflect the diversification effect across asset categories or across other market risk measures. Credit and Funding Spread Sensitivity on Derivatives and Financial Liabilities. VaR excludes the impact of changes in counterparty credit spreads, our own credit spreads and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives, as well as changes in our own credit spreads (debt valuation adjustment) on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected. The estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in credit spreads (counterparty and our own) and unsecured funding spreads on derivatives (including hedges) was a loss of $2 million as of both September 2025 and June 2025. In addition, the estimated sensitivity to a one basis point increase in our own credit spreads on financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected was a gain of $52 million as of September 2025 and $50 million as of June 2025. However, the actual net impact of a change in our own credit spreads is also affected by the liquidity, duration and convexity (as the sensitivity is not linear to changes in yields) of those financial liabilities for which the fair value option was elected, as well as the relative performance of any hedges undertaken. Earnings-at-Risk. The table below presents the impact of a parallel shift in rates on our net revenues and preferred stock dividends over the next 12 months relative to the baseline scenario.

The EaR metric does not represent a forecast of our net revenues and preferred stock dividends. Other Market Risk Considerations We make investments in securities that are accounted for as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity or under the equity method which are included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets.

Credit Risk Management Overview Credit risk represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty (e.g., an OTC derivatives counterparty or a borrower) or an issuer of securities or other instruments we hold. Our exposure to credit risk comes mostly from client transactions in OTC derivatives and loans and lending commitments. Credit risk also comes from cash placed with banks, securities financing transactions (i.e., resale and repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending activities) and customer and other receivables. Credit Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for assessing, monitoring and managing our credit risk by providing independent firmwide oversight and challenge across our global businesses. In addition, we hold other positions that give rise to credit risk (e.g., bonds and secondary bank loans). These credit risks are captured as a component of market risk measures, which are monitored and managed by Market Risk. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. Such derivatives also give rise to credit risk, which is monitored and managed by Credit Risk. Credit Risk Management Process Our process for managing credit risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” as well as the following: •Monitoring compliance with established credit risk limits and reporting our credit exposures and credit concentrations; •Establishing or approving underwriting standards; •Assessing the likelihood that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations; •Measuring our current and potential credit exposure and losses resulting from a counterparty default; •Using credit risk mitigants, including collateral and hedging; and •Maximizing recovery through active workout and restructuring of claims. We also perform credit analyses, which incorporate initial and ongoing evaluations of the capacity and willingness of a counterparty to meet its financial obligations. For substantially all of our credit exposures, the core of our process is an annual counterparty credit evaluation or more frequently if deemed necessary as a result of events or changes in circumstances. We determine an internal credit rating for the counterparty by considering the results of the credit evaluations and assumptions with respect to the nature of and outlook for the counterparty’s industry and the economic environment. For collateralized loans, we also take into consideration collateral received or other credit support arrangements when determining an internal credit rating. Senior personnel, with expertise in specific industries, inspect and approve credit reviews and internal credit ratings. Our risk assessment process may also include, where applicable, reviewing certain key metrics, including, but not limited to, delinquency status, collateral value, FICO credit scores and other risk factors.\n"

These systems also provide management with comprehensive information about our aggregate credit risk by product, internal credit rating, industry, country and region. Risk Measures We measure our credit risk based on the potential loss in the event of non-payment by a counterparty using current and potential exposure. For derivatives and securities financing transactions, current exposure represents the amount presently owed to us after taking into account applicable netting and collateral arrangements, while potential exposure represents our estimate of the future exposure that could arise over the life of a transaction based on market movements within a specified confidence level. Potential exposure also takes into account netting and collateral arrangements. For loans and lending commitments, the primary measure is a function of the notional amount of the position. Stress Tests We conduct regular stress tests to calculate the credit exposures, including potential concentrations that would result from applying shocks to counterparty credit ratings or credit risk factors (e.g., currency rates, interest rates, equity prices). These shocks cover a wide range of moderate and more extreme market movements, including shocks to multiple risk factors, consistent with the occurrence of a severe market or economic event. In the case of sovereign default, we estimate the direct impact of the default on our sovereign credit exposures, changes to our credit exposures arising from potential market moves in response to the default, and the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties that may result from the sovereign default. Unlike potential exposure, which is calculated within a specified confidence level, stress testing does not generally assume a probability of these events occurring. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests. To supplement these regular stress tests, as described above, we also conduct tailored stress tests on an ad hoc basis in response to specific events that we deem significant. We also utilize these stress tests to estimate the indirect impact of certain hypothetical events on our country exposures, such as the impact of credit market deterioration on corporate borrowers and counterparties along with the shocks to the risk factors described above. The parameters of these shocks vary based on the scenario reflected in each stress test. We review estimated losses produced by the stress tests in order to understand their magnitude, highlight potential loss concentrations, and assess and seek to mitigate our exposures, where necessary. Limits We use credit risk limits at various levels, as well as underwriting standards to manage the size and nature of our credit exposures. Limits for industries and countries are based on our risk appetite and are designed to allow for regular monitoring, review, escalation and management of credit risk concentrations. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about the limit approval process. Credit Risk is responsible for monitoring these limits, and identifying and escalating to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee, on a timely basis, instances where limits have been exceeded. Risk Mitigants To reduce our credit exposures on derivatives and securities financing transactions, we may enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit us to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties. We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive. For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment. When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We may also seek to mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.\n"

We may also reduce credit risk with counterparties by entering into agreements that enable us to obtain collateral from them on an upfront or contingent basis and/or to terminate transactions if the counterparty’s credit rating falls below a specified level. We monitor the fair value of the collateral to ensure that our credit exposures are appropriately collateralized. We seek to minimize exposures where there is a significant positive correlation between the creditworthiness of our counterparties and the market value of collateral we receive.\nTEXT: For loans and lending commitments, depending on the credit quality of the borrower and other characteristics of the transaction, we employ a variety of potential risk mitigants. Risk mitigants include collateral provisions, guarantees, covenants, structural seniority of the bank loan claims and, for certain lending commitments, provisions in the legal documentation that allow us to adjust loan amounts, pricing, structure and other terms as market conditions change. The type and structure of risk mitigants employed can significantly influence the degree of credit risk involved in a loan or lending commitment.\nTEXT: When we do not have sufficient visibility into a counterparty’s financial strength or when we believe a counterparty requires support from its parent, we may obtain third-party guarantees of the counterparty’s obligations. We may also seek to mitigate our credit risk using credit derivatives or participation agreements.\nTEXT: Goldman Sachs September 2025 Form 10-Q156\nTEXT: Goldman Sachs September 2025 Form 10-Q\nTITLE: THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC.

The percentage of our credit exposures arising from non-investment-grade counterparties (based on our internally determined public rating agency equivalents) increased compared with December 2024, primarily reflecting an increase in non-investment-grade exposure related to loans and lending commitments and decreases in investment-grade exposure related to cash deposits with central banks and OTC derivatives. Our credit exposures are described further below. Cash and Cash Equivalents. Our credit exposure on cash and cash equivalents arises from our unrestricted cash, and includes both interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing deposits. We seek to mitigate the risk of credit loss, by placing substantially all of our deposits with highly rated banks and central banks.

OTC Derivatives. Our credit exposure on OTC derivatives arises primarily from our market-making activities. As a market maker, we enter into derivative transactions to provide liquidity to clients and to facilitate the transfer and hedging of their risks. We also enter into derivatives to manage market risk exposures. We manage our credit exposure on OTC derivatives using the credit risk process, measures, limits and risk mitigants described above. We generally enter into OTC derivatives transactions under bilateral collateral arrangements that require the daily exchange of collateral. As credit risk is an essential component of fair value, we include a CVA in the fair value of derivatives to reflect counterparty credit risk, as described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. CVA is a function of the present value of expected exposure, the probability of counterparty default and the assumed recovery upon default.

Credit exposure represents the potential for loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of a counterparty or borrower. Market exposure represents the potential for loss in value of our long and short positions due to changes in market prices. Country Exposures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has negatively affected the global economy and increased macroeconomic uncertainty. Our total credit exposure to Ukrainian counterparties or borrowers was not material as of September 2025. Our total market exposure relating to Ukrainian issuers as of September 2025 was $103 million, and was primarily related to sovereign debt. Our credit exposure to Russian counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to Russian issuers were not material as of September 2025. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about our risks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.In addition, economic and/or political uncertainties in Ethiopia, Lebanon and Venezuela have led to concerns about their financial stability. Our credit exposure to counterparties or borrowers and our market exposure to issuers relating to each of these countries was not material as of September 2025. We have a comprehensive framework to monitor, measure and assess our country exposures and to determine our risk appetite. We determine the country of risk by the location of the counterparty, issuer’s assets, where they generate revenue, the country in which they are headquartered, the jurisdiction where a claim against them could be enforced, and/or the government whose policies affect their ability to repay their obligations. We monitor our credit exposure to a specific country both at the individual counterparty level, as well as at the aggregate country level. See “Stress Tests” for information about stress tests that are designed to estimate the direct and indirect impact of events involving the above countries. Operational Risk Management Overview Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, systems or from external events. Our exposure to operational risk arises from routine processing errors, as well as extraordinary incidents, such as major systems failures or legal and regulatory matters, that could occur for us or our third-party vendors. Potential types of loss events related to internal and external operational risk include: •Execution, delivery and process management; •Business disruption and system failures; •Employment practices and workplace safety; •Clients, products and business practices; •Third-party risk, including vendor risk;•Damage to physical assets; •Internal fraud; and •External fraud. Operational Risk, which is part of our second line of defense and reports to our chief risk officer, has primary responsibility for developing and implementing a formalized framework for assessing, monitoring and managing operational risk to support firmwide oversight and challenge of our global businesses, with the goal of maintaining our exposure to operational risk at levels that are within our risk appetite. Operational Risk Management Process Our process for managing operational risk includes the critical components of our risk management framework described in the “Overview and Structure of Risk Management,” including a comprehensive data collection process, as well as firmwide policies and procedures, for operational risk events. We combine top-down and bottom-up approaches to manage and measure operational risk. From a top-down perspective, our senior management assesses firmwide and business-level operational risk profiles. From a bottom-up perspective, our first and second lines of defense are responsible for risk identification and risk management on a day-to-day basis, including escalating operational risks and risk events to senior management.\n"

The Firmwide Compliance and Operational Risk Committee is responsible for overseeing compliance and operational risk for our business. Our operational risk management framework is designed to comply with the operational risk measurement rules under the Capital Framework and has evolved based on the changing needs of our businesses and regulatory guidance. We have established policies that require all employees and consultants to report and escalate operational risk events. When operational risk events are identified, our policies require that the events be documented and analyzed to determine whether changes are required in our systems and/or processes to further mitigate the risk of future events. We use operational risk management applications to capture, analyze, aggregate and report operational risk event data and key metrics. One of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk. Risk Measurement We measure our operational risk exposure using both statistical modeling and scenario analyses, which involve qualitative and quantitative assessments of internal and external operational risk event data and internal control factors for each of our businesses. Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including: •Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities; •The degree of automation in our processes; •New activity information; •The legal and regulatory environment; and •Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties. The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests. Types of Operational Risks Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as third-party risk, business resilience risk and cybersecurity risk. See “Cybersecurity Risk Management” for information about our cybersecurity risk management process. We manage third-party and business resilience risks as follows: Third-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, cybersecurity, reputational, operational or other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. We evaluate whether vendors design, implement, and maintain information security controls consistent with our security policies and standards. Vendors that access and process our information on their infrastructure external to our network are required to undergo an initial risk assessment, resulting in the assignment of a vendor inherent risk rating that is determined based on a number of factors, including the type of data stored and processed by a particular vendor. Subsequently, we conduct re-certifications at a depth and frequency that is commensurate with each vendor’s inherent risk rating as a component of our risk-based approach to vendor oversight. Vendors are required to agree to standard contractual provisions before receiving sensitive information from us. These provisions have specific information security control requirements, which apply to vendors that store, access, transmit or otherwise process sensitive information on our behalf. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk. Business Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for business continuity planning (BCP) and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. We seek to maintain a business continuity program that is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, including resilience capabilities. Our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. See “Business — Business Continuity and Information Security” in Part I, Item 1 of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about business continuity.\n"

One of our key risk identification and control assessment tools is an operational risk and control self-assessment process, which is performed by our managers. This process consists of the identification and rating of operational risks, on a forward-looking basis, and the related controls. The results from this process are analyzed to evaluate operational risk exposures and identify businesses, activities or products with heightened levels of operational risk.\n"

Operational risk measurement also incorporates an assessment of business environment factors, including:\nTEXT: •Evaluations of the complexity of our business activities;\nTEXT: •The degree of automation in our processes;\nTEXT: •The legal and regulatory environment; and\nTEXT: •Changes in the markets for our products and services, including the diversity and sophistication of our customers and counterparties.\nTEXT: The results from these scenario analyses are used to monitor changes in operational risk and to determine business lines that may have heightened exposure to operational risk. We also perform firmwide stress tests. See “Overview and Structure of Risk Management” for information about firmwide stress tests.\nTEXT: Types of Operational Risks Increased reliance on technology and third-party relationships has resulted in increased operational risks, such as third-party risk, business resilience risk and cybersecurity risk. See “Cybersecurity Risk Management” for information about our cybersecurity risk management process. We manage third-party and business resilience risks as follows: Third-Party Risk. Third-party risk, including vendor risk, is the risk of an adverse impact due to reliance on third parties performing services or activities on our behalf. These risks may include legal, regulatory, information security, cybersecurity, reputational, operational or other risks inherent in engaging a third party. We identify, manage and report key third-party risks and conduct due diligence across multiple risk domains, including information security and cybersecurity, resilience and additional supply chain dependencies. We evaluate whether vendors design, implement, and maintain information security controls consistent with our security policies and standards. Vendors that access and process our information on their infrastructure external to our network are required to undergo an initial risk assessment, resulting in the assignment of a vendor inherent risk rating that is determined based on a number of factors, including the type of data stored and processed by a particular vendor. Subsequently, we conduct re-certifications at a depth and frequency that is commensurate with each vendor’s inherent risk rating as a component of our risk-based approach to vendor oversight. Vendors are required to agree to standard contractual provisions before receiving sensitive information from us. These provisions have specific information security control requirements, which apply to vendors that store, access, transmit or otherwise process sensitive information on our behalf. The Third-Party Risk Program monitors, reviews and reassesses third-party risks on an ongoing basis. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about third-party risk. Business Resilience Risk. Business resilience risk is the risk of disruption to our critical processes. We monitor threats and assess risks and seek to ensure our state of readiness in the event of a significant operational disruption to the normal operations of our critical functions or their dependencies, such as critical facilities, systems, third parties, data and/or personnel. Our resilience framework defines the fundamental principles for business continuity planning (BCP) and crisis management to ensure that critical functions can continue to operate in the event of a disruption. We seek to maintain a business continuity program that is comprehensive, consistent on a firmwide basis, and up-to-date, incorporating new information, including resilience capabilities. Our resilience assurance program encompasses testing of response and recovery strategies on a regular basis with the objective of minimizing and preventing significant operational disruptions. See “Business — Business Continuity and Information Security” in Part I, Item 1 of the 2024 Form 10-K for further information about business continuity.\n"

This review includes an analysis of the model documentation, independent testing, an assessment of the appropriateness of the methodology used, and verification of compliance with model development and implementation standards. We regularly refine and enhance our models to reflect changes in market or economic conditions and our business mix. All models are reviewed on an annual basis, and new models or significant changes to existing models and their assumptions are approved prior to implementation. The model validation process incorporates a review of models and trade and risk parameters across a broad range of scenarios (including extreme conditions) in order to critically evaluate and verify: •The model’s conceptual soundness, including the reasonableness of model assumptions, and suitability for intended use; •The testing strategy utilized by the model developers to ensure that the models function as intended; •The suitability of the calculation techniques incorporated in the model; •The model’s accuracy in reflecting the characteristics of the related product and its significant risks; •The model’s consistency with models for similar products; and •The model’s sensitivity to input parameters and assumptions. See “Critical Accounting Policies — Fair Value — Review of Valuation Models,” “Liquidity Risk Management,” “Market Risk Management,” “Credit Risk Management” and “Operational Risk Management” for further information about our use of models within these areas. Other Risk Management In addition to the areas of risks discussed above, we also manage other risks, including capital, climate, compliance, conflicts and reputational. These areas of risks are discussed below. Capital Risk Management Capital risk is the risk that our capital is insufficient to support our business activities under normal and stressed market conditions or we face capital reductions or RWA increases, including from new or revised rules or changes in interpretations of existing rules, and are therefore unable to meet our internal capital targets or external regulatory capital requirements. Capital adequacy is of critical importance to us. We have in place a comprehensive capital management policy that provides a framework, defines objectives and establishes guidelines to assist us in maintaining the appropriate level and composition of capital in both business-as-usual and stressed conditions. Our capital management framework is designed to provide us with the information needed to identify and comprehensively manage risk, and develop and apply projected stress scenarios that capture idiosyncratic vulnerabilities with a goal of holding sufficient capital to remain adequately capitalized even after experiencing a severe stress event. See “Capital Management and Regulatory Capital” for further information about our capital management process. We have established a comprehensive governance structure to manage and oversee our day-to-day capital management activities and to ensure compliance with capital rules and related policies. Our capital management activities are overseen by the Board and its committees. The Board is responsible for approving our annual capital plan and the Risk Committee of the Board approves our capital management policy, which details the risk committees and members of senior management who are responsible for the ongoing monitoring of our capital adequacy and evaluation of current and future regulatory capital requirements, the review of the results of our capital planning and stress tests processes, and the results of our capital models. In addition, our risk committees and senior management are responsible for the review of our contingency capital plan, key capital adequacy metrics, including regulatory capital ratios, and capital plan metrics, such as the payout ratio, as well as monitoring capital targets and potential breaches of capital requirements. Our process for managing capital risk also includes independent oversight by Risk that assesses our capital management framework, regulatory capital policies and related interpretations and escalates certain interpretations to senior management and/or the appropriate risk committee. This oversight includes, among other things, independent review and challenge of our capital ratio targets, planned capital actions and regulatory capital calculations; analysis of the related documentation; independent testing; and an assessment of the appropriateness of the calculations and their alignment with the relevant regulatory capital rules.\n"

Physical risk is the risk that asset values may decline or operations may be disrupted as a result of changes in the climate, while transition risk is the risk that asset values may decline because of changes in climate policies or changes in the underlying economy due to decarbonization. Climate-related and environmental risks manifest in different ways across our businesses. We have continued to make significant enhancements to our climate risk management framework, including steps to further integrate climate risk into our broader risk management processes. We have integrated oversight of climate-related risks into our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the Risk and Public Responsibilities committees. The Risk Committee of the Board oversees firmwide financial and nonfinancial risks, which include climate risk, and, as part of its oversight, receives updates on our risk management approach to climate risk, including our approaches towards scenario analysis and integration into existing risk management processes. The Public Responsibilities Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of our firmwide sustainability strategy and sustainability issues affecting us, including with respect to climate change. As part of its oversight, the Public Responsibilities Committee receives periodic updates on our sustainability strategy and disclosures, and also periodically reviews our governance and related policies and processes for climate and other sustainability-related matters. Senior management within Risk, in coordination with senior management in our revenue-producing units, is responsible for the development of the climate-related and environmental risk program. The objective of this program is to integrate climate-related and environmental risks into existing risk disciplines and business considerations, such as the integration of climate risk into our credit evaluation and underwriting processes for select industries.See “Business — Sustainability” in Part I, Item 1 and “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the 2024 Form 10-K for information about our sustainability initiatives, including in relation to climate transition. Compliance Risk Management Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to our reputation arising from our failure to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations, and our internal policies and procedures. Compliance risk is inherent in all activities through which we conduct our businesses. Our Compliance Risk Management Program, administered by Compliance, assesses our compliance, regulatory and reputational risk; monitors for compliance with new or amended laws, rules and regulations; designs and implements controls, policies, procedures and training; conducts independent testing; investigates, surveils and monitors for compliance risks and breaches; and is a key participant in regulatory examinations, audits and inquiries. We monitor and review business practices to assess whether they meet or exceed minimum regulatory and legal standards in all markets and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Conflicts Management Conflicts of interest and our approach to dealing with them are fundamental to our client relationships, our reputation and our long-term success. The term “conflict of interest” does not have a universally accepted meaning, and conflicts can arise in many forms within a business or between businesses. The responsibility for identifying potential conflicts, as well as complying with our policies and procedures, is shared by all of our employees. We have a multilayered approach to resolving conflicts and addressing reputational risk. Our senior management oversees policies related to conflicts resolution and, in conjunction with Conflicts Resolution, Legal and Compliance, and internal committees, formulates policies, standards and principles, and assists in making judgments regarding the appropriate resolution of particular conflicts. Resolving potential conflicts necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular situation and the application of experienced and informed judgment. As a general matter, Conflicts Resolution reviews financing and advisory assignments in Global Banking & Markets and certain of our investing, lending and other activities. In addition, we have various transaction oversight committees that also review new underwritings, loans, investments and structured products. These groups and committees work with internal and external counsel and Compliance to evaluate and address any actual or potential conflicts. The head of Conflicts Resolution reports to our chief legal officer, who reports to our chief executive officer. We regularly assess our policies and procedures that address conflicts of interest in an effort to conduct our business in accordance with the highest ethical standards and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.\n"
