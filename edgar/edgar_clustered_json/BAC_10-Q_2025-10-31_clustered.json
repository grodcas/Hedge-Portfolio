The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralCertain of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $117.9 billion and $105.9 billion and posted cash and securities collateral of $97.2 billion and $83.1 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. For more information on credit-related contingent features and collateral, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.At September 30, 2025, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $3.2 billion, including $1.7 billion for Bank of America, National Association (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee.

The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, was $400 million and $464 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Corporation reclassified $42 million and $73 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.Credit Card and Other ConsumerCredit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6 months to 72 months, most of which had a 60-month term at September 30, 2025. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The September 30, 2025 amortized cost of credit card and other consumer loans that were modified through these programs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $235 million and $560 million compared to $202 million and $534 million for the same periods in 2024. These modifications represented 0.11 percent and 0.27 percent of outstanding credit card and other consumer loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to 0.10 percent and 0.26 percent for the same periods in 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, the financial effect of modifications resulted in a weighted-average interest rate reduction of 18.26 percent and 17.99 percent compared to 19.13 percent and 19.29 percent for the same periods in 2024 and principal forgiveness of $25 million and $76 million compared to $30 million and $88 million for the same periods in 2024.The Corporation tracks the performance of modified loans to assess effectiveness of modification programs. As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, defaults of credit card and other consumer loans that had been modified within 12 months were insignificant. At September 30, 2025, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty over the last 12 months totaled $675 million, of which $573 million were current, $58 million were 30-89 days past due, and $44 million were greater than 90 days past due. At September 30, 2024, modified credit card and other consumer loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty totaled $665 million, of which $562 million were current, $58 million were 30-89 days past due, and $45 million were greater than 90 days past due.Commercial LoansModifications of loans to commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation’s loss exposure while providing borrowers with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique, reflects the borrower’s individual circumstances and is designed to benefit the borrower while mitigating the Corporation’s risk exposure. Commercial modifications are primarily term extensions and payment forbearances. Payment forbearances involve the Corporation forbearing its contractual right to collect certain payments or payment in full (maturity forbearance) for a defined period of time. Reductions in interest rates and principal forgiveness occur infrequently for commercial borrowers. Principal forgiveness may occur in connection with foreclosure, short sales or other settlement agreements, leading to termination or sale of the loan. The following table provides the ending amortized cost of commercial loans modified during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024.\n"

The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.Credit Card and Other ConsumerCredit card and other consumer loans are primarily modified by placing the customer on a fixed payment plan with a significantly reduced fixed interest rate, with terms ranging from 6 months to 72 months, most of which had a 60-month term at September 30, 2025. In certain circumstances, the Corporation will forgive a portion of the outstanding balance if the borrower makes payments up to a set amount. The Corporation makes modifications directly with borrowers for loans held by the Corporation (internal programs) as well as through third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs).

Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment, may not adequately be reflected in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The economic outlook is a significant factor and incorporates forward-looking information through the use of several macroeconomic scenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over the forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product, unemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events, leading economic indicators, internal and third-party economist views, and industry trends. For more information on the Corporation's credit loss accounting policies including the allowance for credit losses, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The September 30, 2025 estimate for allowance for credit losses was based on various economic scenarios, including a baseline scenario derived from consensus estimates, an adverse scenario reflecting an extended moderate recession, a downside scenario reflecting continued inflation, a tail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing and an upside scenario that considers the potential for improvement above the baseline scenario. The Corporation’s overall weighted economic outlook as of September 30, 2025 deteriorated modestly as compared to the weighted economic outlook estimated as of December 31, 2024 and was relatively consistent compared to June 30, 2025. The weighted economic outlook for the Corporation’s quantitative reserves assumes that the U.S. average unemployment rate will be just under five percent in the fourth quarter of 2025 and increases to approximately five percent in the fourth quarter of 2026. It also assumes U.S. real gross domestic product will grow at 0.7 percent and 1.4 percent year-over-year in the fourth quarters of 2025 and 2026. The allowance for credit losses decreased $73 million and increased $25 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025. There were no significant changes to the qualitative reserves at September 30, 2025 compared to June 30, 2025 or December 31, 2024. The provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was $1.3 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the same period in 2024. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was $4.4 billion, relatively unchanged from the same period in 2024. The decrease in the provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was primarily due to improved asset quality in credit card. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was impacted by improved asset quality in credit card and commercial real estate, partially offset by the dampened macroeconomic outlook and loan growth in commercial.

The loans are sold on a non-recourse basis to consolidated trusts. The securitizations are ongoing, whereas additional receivables will be funded into the trusts by either loan repayments or proceeds from securities issued to third parties, depending on the securitization structure. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trusts includes servicing the receivables and holding various subordinated interests, including an undivided seller’s interest in the credit card receivables and owning certain retained interests.At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying values of the receivables in the trusts totaled $17.1 billion and $18.1 billion, which are included in loans and leases, and the carrying values of senior debt securities that were issued to third-party investors from the trusts totaled $7.9 billion and $8.0 billion, which are included in long-term debt.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs generally at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $6.6 billion and $25.1 billion of securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $4.6 billion and $11.1 billion for the same periods in 2024.

The total assets of these unconsolidated tax credit VIEs were $87.3 billion and $85.7 billion as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. As an investor, tax credits associated with the investments in these entities are allocated to the Corporation, as provided by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and related regulations, and are recognized as income tax benefits in the Corporation’s Consolidated Statement of Income in the year they are earned, which varies based on the type of investments.

A significant portion of these commitments will expire within the next 12 months.At both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $4.0 billion, on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2026 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice.At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation had unfunded equity investment commitments of $927 million and $787 million.As a Federal Reserve member bank, the Corporation is required to subscribe to a certain amount of shares issued by its Federal Reserve district bank, which pays cumulative dividends at a prescribed rate. At both September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation had paid $5.4 billion for half of its subscribed shares, with the remaining half subject to call by the Federal Reserve district bank board, which the Corporation believes is remote.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks.

If charges are properly reversed after a purchase and cannot be collected from either the merchants or merchant acquirers, the Corporation may be held liable for these reversed charges.

The Corporation’s risk in this area primarily relates to circumstances where a cardholder has purchased goods or services for future delivery. The Corporation mitigates this risk by requiring cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit or other types of collateral from certain merchants. The Corporation’s reserves for contingent losses, and the losses incurred related to the merchant processing activity were not significant.\n"

The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation’s best estimate of incurred losses, is based on its experience in previous negotiations, and is subject to judgment, a variety of assumptions and known or unknown uncertainties. At September 30, 2025, the estimated range of possible loss in excess of the accrued representations and warranties reserve was not significant. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material to the Corporation's financial condition and liquidity.Fixed Income Clearing Corporation Sponsored Member Repo ProgramThe Corporation acts as a sponsoring member in a repo program whereby the Corporation clears certain eligible resale and repurchase agreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation on behalf of clients that are sponsored members in accordance with the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation’s rules. As part of this program, the Corporation guarantees the payment and performance of its sponsored members to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation. The Corporation’s guarantee obligation is secured by a security interest in cash or high-quality securities collateral placed by clients with the clearinghouse and therefore, the potential for the Corporation to incur significant losses under this arrangement is remote. The Corporation’s maximum potential exposure, without taking into consideration the related collateral, was $267.9 billion and $191.9 billion at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.Other GuaranteesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Guarantees of Certain Long-term DebtThe Corporation, as the parent company, fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by BofA Finance LLC, a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation, and effectively provides for the full and unconditional guarantee of trust securities and capital securities issued by certain statutory trust companies that are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Other ContingenciesIn 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected from certain insured depository institutions, including the Corporation, and collection began during the three months ended June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s accrual for its estimated share of the FDIC special assessment was $773 million and $1.7 billion. The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s estimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosures supplement the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $59 million and $297 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $38 million and $188 million for the same periods in 2024.For any matter disclosed in this Note and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability), the Corporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.5 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of September 30, 2025.The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.\n"

The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s estimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following disclosures supplement the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable, and, for the matters disclosed below and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, whether a loss in excess of any accrued liability is reasonably possible in future periods. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation and regulatory investigation-related expense of $59 million and $297 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to $38 million and $188 million for the same periods in 2024.For any matter disclosed in this Note and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure for which a loss in future periods is reasonably possible and estimable (whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability), the Corporation’s estimated range of possible loss is $0 to $0.5 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any, as of September 30, 2025.The accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information and subject to significant judgment, a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss are unpredictable and may change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly from the current estimate and accrual. The estimated range of possible loss does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure.\nTITLE: Other Contingencies\nTEXT: In 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to impose a special assessment to recover certain estimated losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) arising from the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The estimated losses will be recovered through quarterly special assessments collected from certain insured depository institutions, including the Corporation, and collection began during the three months ended June 30, 2024. At September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s accrual for its estimated share of the FDIC special assessment was $773 million and $1.7 billion. The Corporation continues to monitor the FDIC’s estimated loss to the DIF, which could affect the amount of its accrued liability.\n"

At the same time, the DC District Court granted BANA’s motion for summary judgment, finding that the FDIC is not entitled to recover with respect to assessments to the DIF totaling $583 million for the period from the first quarter of 2012 to the first quarter of 2013. The DC District Court denied the other claims and counterclaims in the case. On July 3, 2025, BANA paid the FDIC a total of $657 million which reflects the judgment and BANA’s calculation of interest, which had been previously accrued by the Corporation. The FDIC and BANA disagree about the appropriate methodology for the interest calculation, and the parties have requested that the DC District Court resolve the dispute. The FDIC seeks an additional payment of approximately $255 million and additional interest that continues to accrue based on the FDIC’s methodology. BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC with respect to the disputed amount of interest.Fair Access to BankingThe Corporation is responding to demands and requests regarding “fair access to banking,” including those resulting from Executive Order 14331 “Guaranteeing Fair Banking for All Americans” which directed government agencies to review financial institutions’ policies and practices for providing, maintaining, or discontinuing financial products or services to certain clients or potential clients.LIBOROn September 25, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (NY District Court) granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment and dismissed all remaining claims pending against the Corporation, BANA, the Merrill Lynch entities, as well as all other defendant banks on the U.S. Dollar LIBOR panel.

Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Brokerage and Other Assets – Non-discretionary client assets which are held in brokerage accounts or held for safekeeping.Committed Credit Exposure – Any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a specified credit event on one or more referenced obligations.Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer.Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan.Macro Products – Include currencies, interest rates and commodities products.Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions.Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.\n"

The increases in net income were primarily due to higher noninterest income and net interest income, and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest expense.Total assets increased $142.2 billion from December 31, 2024 to $3.4 trillion primarily driven by higher loans and leases due to growth in commercial loans and residential mortgages, higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and higher trading account assets to support Global Markets client activity, as well as higher debt securities due to investment of excess cash from deposit inflows.Total liabilities increased $133.6 billion from December 31, 2024 to $3.1 trillion primarily driven by higher deposits in Global Banking and higher long-term debt issuances, as well as higher trading account liabilities, customer trade payables, and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase to support Global Markets client activity.Shareholders’ equity increased $8.6 billion from December 31, 2024 primarily due to net income, preferred stock issuances and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders through common stock repurchases and common and preferred stock dividends, as well as preferred stock redemptions.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $1.3 billion to $15.2 billion, and $2.6 billion to $44.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased nine basis points (bps) to 2.01 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2025, and three bps to 1.98 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. The increase in net interest income in the three-month period was primarily driven by higher net interest income related to Global Markets activity, fixed-asset repricing, and deposit and loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. The increase in net interest income in the nine-month period was primarily driven by fixed-asset repricing, higher net interest income related to Global Markets activity, and deposit and loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates and one less day of interest accrual.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We may present an adjusted ETR to exclude the tax rate effects of certain tax credits and discrete tax items (adjusted ETR). We believe the presentation of adjusted ETR is useful because it provides additional information to assess the Corporation’s results of operations.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities (“adjusted” shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity). These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth objectives. These ratios are:● Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.● Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total tangible assets.● Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per common share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 5 on page 8.For more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 47.Key Performance IndicatorsWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance indicators (key performance indicators) that management uses when assessing our consolidated and/or segment results.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.When presented on a consolidated basis, we view net interest income on an FTE basis as a non-GAAP financial measure. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)), which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We may present an adjusted ETR to exclude the tax rate effects of certain tax credits and discrete tax items (adjusted ETR). We believe the presentation of adjusted ETR is useful because it provides additional information to assess the Corporation’s results of operations.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure.

The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risk can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement, which are approved annually by the Board’s Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth roles and responsibilities for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our risk appetite provides a common framework that includes a set of measures to assist senior management and the Board in assessing the Corporation’s risk profile across all risk types against our risk appetite and risk capacity. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative statements and quantitative limits.For more information on the Corporation’s risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are being managed within our Risk Framework and supporting risk management programs. For more information on our Risk Framework, risk management activities and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. For more information, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs to submit a capital plan and planned capital actions on an annual basis to help facilitate supervisory stress testing. Based on the results of our 2025 CCAR stress test under the current regulatory framework, our SCB decreased to 2.5 percent from 3.2 percent, resulting in a Common equity tier 1 (CET1) minimum requirement of 10.0 percent, effective October 1, 2025. At September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s CET1 ratio was 11.6 percent under the Standardized approach.During the three months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock pursuant to Board authorizations of the Corporation’s common stock repurchase programs. For more information, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds on page 104 and Capital Management – CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).As part of our planned capital actions, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Corporation paid common stock dividends of $2.1 billion.On October 23, 2025, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.28 per share, payable on December 26, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 5, 2025.Regulatory CapitalAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators, including U.S. implementation of the Basel Framework. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s minimum CET1 ratio requirements were 10.7 percent under the Standardized approach and 10.0 percent under the Advanced approaches.The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach for various factors. The Corporation’s Method 1 G-SIB surcharge is 1.5 percent, and its Method 2 G-SIB surcharge is 3.0 percent. The Corporation’s Method 2 G-SIB surcharge is expected to increase to 3.5 percent on January 1, 2027, unless its surcharge calculated as of December 31, 2025 is lower than 3.5 percent.

For more information, see Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds on page 104 and Capital Management – CCAR and Capital Planning in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: The timing and amount of common stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, regulatory requirements and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. Such repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act).As part of our planned capital actions, during the three months ended September 30, 2025, the Corporation paid common stock dividends of $2.1 billion.On October 23, 2025, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.28 per share, payable on December 26, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 5, 2025.Regulatory CapitalAs a BHC, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators, including U.S. implementation of the Basel Framework. The Corporation's depository institution subsidiaries are also subject to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets (RWA) under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The lower of the capital ratios under Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the PCA framework. As of September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s binding ratio was the Total capital ratio under the Standardized approach.Minimum Capital RequirementsIn order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent (under the Advanced approaches only), an SCB (under the Standardized approach only), plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital. For the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025, the Corporation’s minimum CET1 ratio requirements were 10.7 percent under the Standardized approach and 10.0 percent under the Advanced approaches.The Corporation is required to calculate its G-SIB surcharge on an annual basis under two methods and is subject to the higher of the resulting two surcharges. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s assessment methodology and is calculated using specified indicators of systemic importance. Method 2 modifies the Method 1 approach for various factors. The Corporation’s Method 1 G-SIB surcharge is 1.5 percent, and its Method 2 G-SIB surcharge is 3.0 percent.

To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. These liquidity risk management practices have allowed us to effectively manage market fluctuations from the rising interest rate environment, inflationary pressures and changes in the macroeconomic environment.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as they arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events.We provide centralized funding and liquidity management through a variety of activities, including monitoring of established limits, assessing exposures under both normal and stressed conditions and reviewing liquidity risk management processes and controls. Global Risk Management (GRM) provides oversight of liquidity management across the Corporation, including front-line units and legal entities. GRM oversees the liquidity risk management governance structure, establishes liquidity risk policies, and provides independent review and challenge of the Corporation's liquidity risk management processes.For more information on the Corporation’s liquidity risks, see the Liquidity section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, as well as liquidity sources, liquidity arrangements, contingency planning and credit ratings discussed below, see Liquidity Risk in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.NB Holdings CorporationBank of America Corporation, as the parent company (the Parent), which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our bank and nonbank subsidiaries, has an intercompany arrangement with our wholly-owned holding company subsidiary, NB Holdings Corporation (NB Holdings).

The Parent is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had it not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.

Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the Parent and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other investment-grade securities, and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.Table 13 presents average GLS for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.Table 13Average Global Liquidity SourcesThree Months Ended(Dollars in billions)September 302025December 312024Bank entities$768 $777 Nonbank and other entities (1)193 176 Total Average Global Liquidity Sources$961 $953 (1) Nonbank includes Parent, NB Holdings and other regulated entities.Our bank subsidiaries’ liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity.

However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $664 billion and $623 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

For more information on liquidity stress analysis, see Liquidity Risk – Liquidity Stress Analysis in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Net Stable Funding RatioThe Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a liquidity requirement for large banks to maintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year period. The requirement is intended to support the ability of banks to lend to households and businesses in both normal and adverse economic conditions and is complementary to the LCR, which focuses on short-term liquidity risks. The U.S. NSFR applies to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. At September 30, 2025, the Corporation and its insured depository institutions were in compliance with the U.S. NSFR.

Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions.DepositsOur deposit base is well-diversified by clients, geography and product type across our business segments. At September 30, 2025, 47 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking, 14 percent in GWIM and 32 percent in Global Banking. We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At September 30, 2025 approximately 69 percent of consumer and small business deposits and approximately 81 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years.

At September 30, 2025, 47 percent of our deposits were in Consumer Banking, 14 percent in GWIM and 32 percent in Global Banking. We consider a substantial portion of our deposit base to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of liquidity. At September 30, 2025 approximately 69 percent of consumer and small business deposits and approximately 81 percent of U.S. deposits in Global Banking were held by clients who have had accounts with us for 10 or more years. In addition, at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, 26 percent and 27 percent of our deposits were noninterest bearing and included operating accounts of our consumer and commercial clients. Deposits at September 30, 2025 increased $36.7 billion from December 31, 2024 primarily due to deposit growth in Global Banking from existing clients and the addition of new clients.\nTEXT: During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, rates paid on deposits were 58 bps and 65 bps in Consumer Banking, 249 bps and 313 bps in GWIM, and 280 bps and 327 bps in Global Banking. For information on rates paid on consolidated deposit balances, see Table 6 on page 9.\n"

The Corporation guarantees the due and punctual payment, on demand, of amounts payable on the Guaranteed Notes if not paid by BofA Finance. In addition, each of BAC Capital Trust XIII, BAC Capital Trust XIV and BAC Capital Trust XV, Delaware statutory trusts (collectively, the Trusts) is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of the Corporation that has issued and sold trust preferred securities (the Trust Preferred Securities) or capital securities (the Capital Securities and, together with the Guaranteed Notes and the Trust Preferred Securities, the Guaranteed Securities), as applicable, that remained outstanding at September 30, 2025. The Corporation has fully and unconditionally guaranteed (or effectively provided for the full and unconditional guarantee of) all such securities issued by such finance subsidiaries. For more information regarding such guarantees by the Corporation, see Liquidity Risk – Finance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and Warranties ObligationsFor information on representations and warranties obligations in connection with the sale of mortgage loans, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Risk ManagementFor information on our credit risk management activities, see the following: Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 28, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 33, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 39, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 40, Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Credit Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on the Corporation’s credit risks, see the Credit section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on the Corporation’s economic and geopolitical risks, see the Geopolitical section within Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, our net charge-off ratio decreased compared to the same period in 2024 primarily driven by lower commercial real estate office charge-offs. Commercial reservable criticized exposure decreased $163 million, and nonperforming loans decreased $628 million compared to December 31, 2024 driven by the commercial real estate portfolio. Ongoing uncertainty surrounding international trade policy negotiations and tensions, persistent inflationary pressures, interest rates and ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on the broader economic outlook. Additionally, the current lapse in government funding and the potential for a prolonged pause in some U.S. government functions could disrupt economic activity, delay federal spending and increase financial market volatility. These factors have been assessed for any impacts to the portfolio and may contribute to future deterioration in credit quality metrics as they evolve.Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower’s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources, such as credit bureaus, and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2025, the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices remained relatively stable. During the three months ended September 30, 2025, net charge-offs decreased $66 million to $978 million compared to the same period in 2024, primarily driven by the credit card portfolio. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025, net charge-offs remained relatively unchanged at $3.2 billion compared to the same period in 2024.The consumer allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $118 million to $8.5 billion from December 31, 2024. For more information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 40.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and loan modifications for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Additionally, higher interest rates negatively impact the fair value of our debt securities classified as available for sale and adversely affect accumulated OCI, and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital would be reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income generated from banking book activities. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 20.As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity. The sensitivity analysis in Table 41 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. In higher rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that a portion of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits is replaced with higher yielding deposits or market-based funding. Conversely, in lower rate scenarios, the analysis assumes that a portion of higher yielding deposits or market-based funding is replaced with low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits.For larger interest rate shift scenarios, the interest rate sensitivity may behave in a non-linear manner as there are numerous estimates and assumptions, which require a high degree of judgment and are often interrelated, that could impact the outcome. Pertaining to the mortgage-backed securities and residential mortgage portfolio, if long-end interest rates were to significantly decrease over the next twelve months, for example over 200 bps, there would generally be an increase in customer prepayment behaviors with an incremental reduction to net interest income, noting that the extent of changes in customer prepayment activity can be impacted by multiple factors and is not necessarily limited to long-end interest rates. Conversely, if long-end interest rates were to significantly increase over the next twelve months, for example, over 200 bps, customer prepayments would likely modestly decrease and result in an incremental increase to net interest income. In addition, deposit pricing is rate sensitive in nature. This sensitivity is assumed to have non-linear impacts to larger short-end rate movements. In decreasing interest rate scenarios, and particularly where interest rates have decreased to small amounts, the ability to further reduce rates paid is reduced as customer rates near zero. In higher short-end rate scenarios, deposit pricing will likely increase at a faster rate, leading to incremental interest expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.Economic Value of EquityIn addition to interest rate sensitivity described above, the Corporation’s management of its interest rate exposures in the banking book also considers a long-term view of interest rate sensitivity through the measurement of Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE captures changes in the net present value of banking book assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios and its impact to Tier 1 capital. Similar to net interest income, the Corporation establishes limits for EVE. EVE is largely driven by the Corporation’s longer duration fixed-rate products, such as investment securities, residential mortgages and deposits. For assets or liabilities that have no stated maturity, such as deposits, the Corporation estimates the duration for measurement purposes.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsWe use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives. Designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in Table 41. The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\n"

The Corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations. By hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations, the Corporation's market risk exposure in this area is not significant.\nTEXT: expense and reducing asset sensitivity. While the impact related to the above assumptions used in the asset sensitivity analysis can provide directional analysis on how net interest income will be impacted in changing environments, the ultimate impact is dependent upon the interrelationship of the assumptions and factors, which vary in different macroeconomic scenarios.\nTITLE: Economic Value of Equity\nTEXT: In addition to interest rate sensitivity described above, the Corporation’s management of its interest rate exposures in the banking book also considers a long-term view of interest rate sensitivity through the measurement of Economic Value of Equity (EVE). EVE captures changes in the net present value of banking book assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios and its impact to Tier 1 capital. Similar to net interest income, the Corporation establishes limits for EVE. EVE is largely driven by the Corporation’s longer duration fixed-rate products, such as investment securities, residential mortgages and deposits. For assets or liabilities that have no stated maturity, such as deposits, the Corporation estimates the duration for measurement purposes.\nTITLE: Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative Contracts\nTEXT: We use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our ALM activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. Specifically, we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks. Our interest rate derivative contracts are generally non-leveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, and our foreign exchange contracts include cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options.\nTEXT: The derivatives used in our ALM activities can be split into two broad categories: designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives.

For more information on the accounting for derivatives, see Note 3 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), as well as the value of the MSRs. Because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities. For more information on IRLCs and the related residential mortgage LHFS, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Climate RiskClimate risk is divided into two major categories, both of which span the seven key risk types discussed in Managing Risk on page 20: (1) Physical Risk: risks related to the physical impacts of climate change, driven by extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods, as well as chronic longer-term shifts such as rising average global temperatures and sea levels, and (2) Transition Risk: risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy, which may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes.Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent and severe extreme weather events, can increase the Corporation’s risks, including credit risk by diminishing borrowers’ repayment capacity or collateral values, and operational risk by negatively impacting the Corporation’s facilities, employees, or third parties. Transition risks of climate change may amplify credit risks through the financial impacts of changes in policy, technology or the market on the Corporation or our counterparties. Unanticipated market changes can lead to sudden price adjustments and give rise to heightened market risk.Our approach to managing climate risk is consistent with our risk management governance structure, from senior management to our Board and its committees, including the ERC and the Corporate Governance Committee (CGC) of the Board, which regularly discuss climate-related topics. The ERC oversees climate risk as set forth in our Risk Framework and Risk Appetite Statement. The CGC is responsible for overseeing the Corporation’s environmental sustainability-related activities and practices, and regularly reviews the Corporation’s related initiatives and policies.Our Climate and Environmental Risk Council consists of leaders across risk, Front Line Units (FLUs) and control functions, and meets routinely to discuss our approach to managing climate-related risks. The Corporation has a Climate and Environmental Risk Management function that is responsible for overseeing climate risk management. They are responsible for establishing the Climate Risk Framework (described below) and governance structure, and providing an independent assessment of enterprise-wide climate risks.Based on the Corporation’s Risk Framework, we created our internal Climate Risk Framework, which addresses various global climate-related laws, rules, regulations and guidance. The framework describes how the Corporation identifies, measures, monitors and controls climate risk by enhancing existing risk management processes, includes examples of how climate risk manifests across the seven risk types, and details the roles and responsibilities for climate risk management across our three lines of defense (i.e., FLUs, Global Risk Management and Corporate Audit).For more information on our governance framework, see the Managing Risk section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
