The financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nTEXT: Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (2024 Form 10-K).\nTEXT: The December 31, 2024 financial position data included herein is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2024 Form 10-K but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation.\nTEXT: Cat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. Credit risk was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.

Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted\nTEXT: Income tax reporting (ASU 2023-09) — In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance to expand the annual disclosure requirements for income taxes, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The expanded disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2025, and can be applied prospectively or retrospectively. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of this new guidance on the related disclosures.\nTEXT: Disaggregation of income statement expenses (ASU 2024-03) — In November 2024, the FASB issued accounting guidance to enhance transparency into the nature and function of income statement expenses. The amendments require that on an annual and interim basis, entities disclose disaggregated operating expense information about specific categories, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and amortization. The expanded annual disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2027, and the expanded interim disclosures are effective in 2028, with early adoption permitted. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of this new guidance on the related disclosures.\nTEXT: Internal-use software costs (ASU 2025-06) — In September 2025, the FASB issued accounting guidance to modernize the accounting for internal-use software costs. Under this guidance, capitalization for internal-use software costs begins when management has authorized and committed to funding the project and it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform the intended function. This guidance is effective January 1, 2028, with early adoption permitted, and can be applied on a prospective basis, a modified basis for in-process projects, or a retrospective basis.

We recognize trade receivables from dealers and end users in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade and other in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $8,710 million, $7,864 million and $7,923 million as of September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $741 million, $640 million and $589 million as of September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nTEXT: For certain contracts, we invoice for payment when contractual milestones are achieved. We recognize a contract asset when a sale is recognized before achieving the contractual milestones for invoicing. We reduce the contract asset when we invoice for payment and recognize a corresponding trade receivable. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Contract assets were $217 million, $238 million and $246 million as of September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nTEXT: We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products. We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Contract liabilities were $4,423 million, $2,745 million and $2,389 million as of September 30, 2025, December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We reduce the contract liability when revenue is recognized. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, we recognized $351 million and $1,496 million, respectively, of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2025. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized $222 million and $1,395 million, respectively, of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2024.\nTEXT: We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. We report the estimated cost of these discounts as a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the product sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, which represents discounts we expect to pay on units sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, we report the difference as a change in the transaction price in the subsequent period when the final discount is paid. As a result of differences between actual and estimated payments and changes in estimates, we recognized a decrease in revenue of $61 million and $515 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, respectively, related to prior period sales. The change in revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to prior periods sales was inconsequential. Generally, we estimate the cost of these discounts for each product by model by geographic region based on historical experience and changes in merchandising programs known as of the period end financial reporting date. Products sold to dealers in a prior period\nTEXT: that remained in dealer inventory during 2025 were subject to merchandising program actions taken in 2025 which resulted in higher discounts paid in the current year.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2025, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $22.5 billion, with about one-half of the amount expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following September 30, 2025. We have elected the practical expedient not to disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.\nTEXT: See Note 16 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.\nTITLE: 4.

We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. For foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges, the interim settlements are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument within Interest expense. We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow.\nTEXT: We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\nTEXT: We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate risk\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of September 30, 2025, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\nTEXT: We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\n"

Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities. We designate float-to-float cross currency contracts as fair value hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nTEXT: We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products. We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the remaining term of the previously designated hedged item.\nTEXT: Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\nTEXT: Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: Deferred compensation plan liability risk\nTEXT: We are also exposed to variability in compensation expense related to certain non-qualified deferred compensation obligations to employees.

Under the guarantees, non-performance by the third-parties could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligation by providing goods, services or financial compensation. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts possibly recoverable) that we could be required to make under the guarantees was $491 million and $368 million at September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nTEXT: We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.\nTEXT: No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the SPC’s assets of $1.1 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1.1 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\nTEXT: We determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America).

We advanced the $3.0 billion and received approximately 5.7 million shares of Caterpillar common stock, approximately 70% of the estimated final number of shares to be repurchased, with a value of $2.1 billion. The final number of shares to ultimately be repurchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements. The final settlement of the ASR agreements is scheduled to occur during the fourth quarter of 2025.

In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\nTEXT: We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\nTEXT: In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTEXT: Our operations in Brazil are subject to highly complex labor, tax, customs and other laws. While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws, we are periodically engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws, including certain tax and customs disputes with federal, state and municipal authorities in Brazil relating to export activities associated with Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential losses; however, we currently believe that any matters raised will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTITLE: 15. Income taxes\nTITLE: Income taxes\nTEXT: The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2025 was 26.7 percent compared to 20.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 was 24.1 percent compared to 21.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 was negatively impacted by a change in tax incentives resulting from U.S. tax legislation enacted on July 4, 2025, which reinstated 100 percent bonus depreciation and full expensing of U.S. research and development expenditures. The provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025 included a tax charge of $41 million, compared to tax benefits of $47 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, to reflect changes in estimates related to prior years.\nTITLE: 16.

Responsibilities also include the remanufacturing of Caterpillar reciprocating engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.\nTEXT: Financial Products Segment: Provides financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products and services, as well as financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, revolving charge accounts, installment sale contracts, repair/rebuild financing, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides insurance and risk management products and services that help customers and dealers manage their business risk. Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage and maintenance plans for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help support the purchase and lease of Caterpillar equipment. The segment also earns revenues from Machinery, Energy & Transportation, but the related costs are not allocated to operating segments. Financial Products’ segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items.\nTEXT: All Other Segment: Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy; product management and development; parts distribution; integrated logistics solutions; electronics and control systems; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration, including a wholly owned dealer in Japan; dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; brand management and marketing strategy; research and development for automation, electronics and software for machines and engines and digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience.

Segment measurement and reconciliations\nTEXT: We determine the segment profit of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment on a pretax basis and exclude most interest expense and certain other income (expense) items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income (expense) items.\nTEXT: Our CODM evaluates the operating performance of the segments using segment profit as it provides insight into the financial health of each segment. The CODM reviews this metric regularly to compare the profitability of segments, identify trends, and evaluate which segments require additional resources or strategic adjustments. The CODM uses segment profit to support the allocation of resources predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. Additionally, the CODM monitors forecast-to-actual variances, focusing on areas where performance deviates from\nTEXT: expectations, when evaluating the performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment.\nTEXT: There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:\nTEXT: •For Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. We generally manage at the corporate level liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances, and we do not include these in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\nTEXT: •We value segment inventories and cost of sales using a current cost methodology.\nTEXT: •We amortize goodwill allocated to segments using a fixed amount based on a 20-year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.\nTEXT: •We generally manage currency exposures for operating segments, other than Financial Products, at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit or segment assets the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations and financial position within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.\nTEXT: •Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 33-35 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\nTEXT: •Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.\nTEXT: •Restructuring income/costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 20 for more information.\nTEXT: •Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: •Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, we report certain costs on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.\n"

If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\nTEXT: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025, Cat Financial's forecasts reflect a continuation of global market uncertainty and actions by global central banks aimed at balancing economic growth and managing inflation. Cat Financial believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\nTITLE: Dealer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans and working capital loans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide financing to dealers for their primarily new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured retail loans to Caterpillar dealers.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTEXT: In general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTITLE: Classes of finance receivables\nTEXT: Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\nTITLE: •North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\nTITLE: •EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia.\nTITLE: •Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\nTITLE: •Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.\n"

Fair value measurements\nTITLE: Fair value measurements\nTEXT: The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\n"

In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3.\nTEXT: We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. We may therefore classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nTEXT: Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\nTEXT: Investments in debt and equity securities\nTEXT: We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: See Note 8 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\nTEXT: Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate.

Customers continue to be responsive to the attractive rates through our merchandising programs with Cat Financial. We continue to anticipate growth in Construction Industries’ sales of equipment to end users in 2025 despite softness in the global industry. In North America, overall construction spending remains at healthy levels and infrastructure projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) continue to be awarded. We continue to expect growth for sales of equipment to end users. Dealer rental revenues are also expected to grow in 2025, and dealer rental fleet loading is expected to increase in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. In Asia Pacific, sales of equipment to end users are expected to be about flat in 2025. China has shown positive momentum to start the year, and we expect growth in the above-10-ton excavator industry in 2025, but from a very low level of activity. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect economic conditions to be soft. In EAME, we expect growth for the year, driven by healthy construction activity in Africa and the Middle East and improving economic conditions in Europe. With ongoing weaker construction activity in Latin America, we now expect to be about flat in 2025.\nTEXT: In Resource Industries, we anticipate lower sales of equipment to end users in 2025 as compared to 2024, as customers continue to display capital discipline. However, we see positive momentum with healthy orders for large mining trucks, articulated trucks and large track type tractors. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, declining coal prices have caused an increase in the number of parked trucks. As a result, we continue to expect slightly lower rebuild activity in 2025 as compared to 2024. Overall, customer product utilization remains high, and the age of the fleet remains elevated. We also continue to see growing demand and customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions.\nTEXT: In Energy & Transportation, we expect strong growth in sales for Power Generation in 2025 as compared to 2024. Demand remains robust, driven by data center growth related to cloud computing and generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Orders for prime power applications are healthy. In Oil and Gas, we expect moderate growth in 2025. For reciprocating engines and services, we continue to expect softness in well servicing due to ongoing capital discipline, industry consolidation and efficiency improvements in our customers’ operations. We see positive momentum in demand for reciprocating engines used in gas compression applications. For turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil and Gas applications, backlog remains strong, and we see healthy order and inquiry activity. Demand for products in Industrial applications is improving from previous low levels, with order growth being driven by engines sold into electric power applications. Transportation is expected to remain stable.\nTEXT: Full-Year 2025 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: We are optimistic about our sales and revenues momentum supported by healthy demand signals including a robust backlog and growth in sales of equipment to end users.\nTEXT: For 2025, we expect sales and revenues to increase modestly compared to 2024. Services revenues are expected to be about flat for 2025 as compared to 2024.\nTEXT: Tariff and trade negotiations remain fluid. We are continuously evaluating options to further reduce the impact of incremental tariffs, and we fully intend to implement longer-term actions once there is sufficient certainty. We remain confident that we will manage the impact of tariffs over time.\nTEXT: Based on the incremental tariffs announced in 2025 and in place by November 1, 2025, we expect the impact from incremental tariffs for 2025 will be around $1.6 billion to $1.75 billion, net of some mitigating actions and cost controls. This assumes that the net incremental impact of tariffs will be greater in the fourth quarter of 2025 than the third quarter of 2025, primarily due to the timing of tariff rate changes.\nTEXT: In 2025, we continue to expect restructuring costs of approximately $300 million to $350 million and capital expenditures of around $2.5 billion.

We expect higher sales volume to be mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. We also expect higher sales of equipment to end users. We anticipate price realization for the fourth quarter of 2025 to be about neutral as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. In Resource Industries, we expect stronger sales in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by higher sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable price realization. We expect higher sales volume to be mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. We expect lower sales of equipment to end users. The unfavorable impact of price realization in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024 is expected to be slightly less than the impact in the third quarter of 2025 as compared to the third quarter of 2024. In Energy & Transportation, we anticipate strong sales growth in the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, primarily driven by continued strength in Power Generation. We also expect higher sales in Oil and Gas, driven by turbines and turbine-related services. Price realization should remain favorable as well. The sales growth rate for Energy & Transportation in the fourth quarter of 2025, as compared to the third quarter of 2025, is expected to be slightly lower than the growth rate in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the third quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect the profit impact of higher sales volume will be partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs.\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2025, we anticipate a net incremental tariff impact of about $650 million to $800 million.\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2025 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, in Construction Industries, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we expect a profit impact of higher sales volume, which we anticipate will include a partial offset from an unfavorable mix of products.

In Resource Industries, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate the profit impact from higher sales volume will be partially offset by unfavorable price realization. We expect about 20 percent of the net incremental tariff impact will be incurred in Resource Industries. In Energy & Transportation, excluding the net impact from incremental tariffs, we anticipate the profit impact from higher sales volume and favorable price realization will be partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs. We expect about 25 percent of the fourth quarter net incremental tariff impact will be incurred in Energy & Transportation.

In May 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022, with no expiration. In June 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization (the 2024 Authorization) of up to $20.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, effective June 12, 2024, with no expiration. In the first nine months of 2025, we repurchased $4.850 billion of Caterpillar common stock. As of September 30, 2025, the 2022 Authorization was fully utilized and $15.280 billion remained available under the 2024 Authorization. Our basic shares outstanding as of September 30, 2025 were approximately 468 million.\n"

Net cash used for investing activities was $2.150 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $1.900 billion for the same period in 2024. The change was primarily due to portfolio related activity, partially offset by the 2024 divestiture of a non-U.S. subsidiary. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.422 billion in the first nine months of 2025, compared with $890 million for the same period in 2024. The change was primarily due to increased intercompany borrowings from ME&T, partially offset by decreased external borrowings.\nTITLE: RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nTEXT: For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – “New accounting guidance” of Part I, Item 1 \"Financial Statements.\"\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nTEXT: For a discussion of the company’s critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTITLE: OTHER MATTERS\nTEXT: Information related to legal proceedings appears in Note 14 – \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements.”\nTITLE: Retirement Benefits\nTEXT: We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We will record the annual mark-to-market adjustment as of the measurement date, December 31, 2025. It is difficult to predict the December 31, 2025 adjustment amount, as it will be dependent primarily on changes in discount rates during 2025, and actual returns on plan assets differing from our expected returns for 2025.\nTITLE: Order Backlog\nTEXT: At the end of the third quarter of 2025, the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $39.8 billion, about $2.4 billion higher than the second quarter of 2025 due to increases in the Energy & Transportation segment. Of the total backlog at September 30, 2025, approximately $12.5 billion was not expected to be filled in the following twelve months.\n"
