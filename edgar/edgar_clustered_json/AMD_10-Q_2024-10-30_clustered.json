The increase in net revenue was driven by an increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct™ GPU shipments and growth in AMD EPYC™ CPU sales, and an increase in Client segment revenue primarily driven by strong demand for “Zen 5” AMD Ryzen™ processors, partially offset by a decrease in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to lower semi-custom revenue, and a decrease in Embedded segment revenue as customers continued to normalize their inventory levels.\nTEXT: Gross margin for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 50% compared to gross margin of 47% for the prior year period.

Net income for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was $771 million compared to net income of $299 million for the prior year period. The increase in operating and net income was primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin, and lower amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, partially offset by increased operating expenses.\nTEXT: As of September 28, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.5 billion compared to $5.8 billion as of December 30, 2023. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we generated $628 million and $1.7 billion of cash, respectively, from operating activities, and we returned $250 million and $606 million, respectively, to shareholders through the repurchase of common stock under our Repurchase Program.\nTEXT: As part of the next step in our AI strategy, on August 9, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Silo AI, an AI lab based in Finland in an all-cash transaction of $665 million, which resulted in a net purchase consideration of $553 million. The acquisition of Silo AI expands our ability to accelerate development and deployment of AI models on AMD hardware. Silo AI financial results, which were immaterial, were included in our statement of operations from the date of acquisition primarily within the Data Center segment.\nTEXT: On August 17, 2024, we entered into an agreement to acquire ZT Systems, a provider of AI and general-purpose compute infrastructure for hyperscale computing companies, in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $4.9 billion (the Acquisition). Upon closing of the Acquisition, we will pay approximately $3.4 billion in cash and 8,335,852 shares of the Company’s common stock and to the extent certain conditions are met, we will pay an additional $300 million of cash and up to 740,963 shares of the Company’s common stock. The Acquisition is expected to close in the first half of fiscal year 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We intend to seek a strategic partner to acquire ZT Systems' manufacturing business.\nTEXT: We intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n"
