Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, viewing patterns of capitalized video content, and the determination of when to capitalize certain costs relating to new products or service offerings. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis.\nTEXT: Effective January 1, 2025 we changed our estimate of the useful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years. The shorter useful lives are due to the increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The reclassification adjustment for the gain on available-for-sale debt securities of $3.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2025 is primarily from the portion of our convertible notes investments in Anthropic, PBC (“Anthropic”) that were converted to nonvoting preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2025.\nTITLE: Inventories\nTEXT: Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.

Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which include amounts related to non-income taxes and satellite network launch services deposits, were $6.3 billion and $6.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025. We currently expense satellite network launch services deposits upon launch to “Technology and infrastructure.”\nTEXT: We estimate losses on receivables based on expected losses, including our historical experience of actual losses.

Total video and music expense was $4.6 billion and $5.1 billion in Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $9.2 billion and $10.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025.\nTITLE: Unearned Revenue\nTEXT: Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 was $24.6 billion, of which $11.4 billion was recognized as revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2025. Included in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion of unearned revenue as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our consolidated financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $195 billion as of June 30, 2025. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 4.0 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\n"

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Some of these notes converted to nonvoting preferred stock in Q1 2025. As a result of conversions, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and a gain of approximately $3.3 billion was recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment in nonvoting preferred stock was initially recorded at its estimated fair value at the time of the conversion and will be accounted for as a component of our equity investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity-method, with future adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments recognized in “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of\nTEXT: operations.

The weighted-average remaining term of the financing obligations was 16.1 years and 15.5 years and the weighted-average imputed interest rate was 3.1% as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: (2)Includes unconditional purchase obligations related to long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content, procure energy, acquire property and equipment, and license software that are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligations associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. Energy agreements based on actual generation without a fixed or minimum volume commitment are not included. Our energy agreements generally provide the right to receive energy certificates for no additional consideration.\nTEXT: (3)Includes asset retirement obligations, the estimated timing and amounts of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements that are under construction, and liabilities associated with digital media content agreements with initial terms greater than one year. Excludes approximately $5.8 billion of income tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment, if any.\nTITLE: Other Contingencies\nTEXT: We are disputing claims and denials of refunds or credits, and monitoring or evaluating potential claims, related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit these taxes. These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.\nTITLE: Legal Proceedings\nTEXT: The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the matters described in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies — Legal Proceedings” of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025, as supplemented by the following:\nTEXT: In June 2025, Xockets, Inc. filed two complaints against Amazon.com, Inc. and Amazon Web Services, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. The complaints allege, among other things, that certain versions of the AWS Nitro System infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 11,080,209; 10,649,924; 11,082,350; 10,223,297; 9,378,161; 9,436,640; and\nTEXT: 10,212,092. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, interest, and injunctive relief. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nTEXT: In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.\nTEXT: The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTEXT: See also “Note 7 — Income Taxes.”\nTITLE: Maturities (1)Stated Interest RatesEffective Interest RatesDecember 31, 2024June 30, 2025\nTITLE: Maturities (1)\nTITLE: Stated Interest Rates\nTITLE: Effective Interest Rates\nTITLE: December 31, 2024\n"

The Credit Facility bore interest based on the daily Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 1.25%, and had a commitment fee of up to 0.45% on the undrawn portion.\nTEXT: In January 2023, we entered into an $8.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan with a syndicate of lenders (the “Term Loan”), maturing in January 2024 and bearing interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Term Loan plus 0.75%.

In April 2025, we increased the size of the Commercial Paper Programs from $20.0 billion to $30.0 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Programs as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025. We use the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper for general corporate purposes.\nTEXT: We have a $15.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Credit Agreement”), with a term that extends to November 2028 and may be extended for one or more additional one-year terms subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Credit Agreement is the applicable benchmark rate specified in the Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion of the credit facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: We have a $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders (the “Short-Term Credit Agreement”), which matures in October 2025 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the Short-Term Credit Agreement is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate specified in the Short-Term Credit Agreement plus 0.45%, with a commitment fee of 0.03% on the undrawn portion. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $151 million and $173 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $9.0 billion of unused letters of credit as of June 30, 2025.\nTITLE: Stock Repurchase Activity\nTEXT: In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration. There were no repurchases of our common stock during the six months ended June 30, 2024 or 2025. As of June 30, 2025, we have $6.1 billion remaining under the repurchase program.\nTITLE: Stock Award Plans\nTEXT: Employees vest in restricted stock unit awards over the corresponding service term, generally between two and five years.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nTEXT: Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of June 30, 2025, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $430 million.\nTEXT: In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nTEXT: We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\nTEXT: change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\nTEXT: Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\nTEXT: We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n"

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital.

Cash capital expenditures were $16.4 billion and $31.4 billion during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $30.3 billion and $55.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network, both of which we expect to increase in 2025. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $571 million and $1.7 billion during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $3.9 billion and $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in convertible notes from Anthropic, including $1.3 billion we invested in Q2 2025. Furthermore, we will invest an additional $1.4 billion in another convertible note by Q4 2025.\nTEXT: Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(4.5) billion and $(2.5) billion for Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $(5.7) billion and $(2.6) billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $525 million and $2.1 billion for Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $863 million and $4.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $5.0 billion and $4.6 billion for Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $181 million and $937 million during Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $223 million and $991 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025.\nTEXT: We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of June 30, 2025.

The 2025 Tax Act makes changes to the U.S. corporate income tax, including reinstating the option to claim 100% accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property, with retroactive application beginning January 20, 2025 and immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, with retroactive application beginning January 1, 2025. While we are still evaluating the full extent of the 2025 Tax Act’s impact, we expect these changes to significantly reduce U.S. cash taxes we pay in 2025. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $5.7 billion and $4.8 billion for Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $6.2 billion and $5.6 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025.\n"

However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\nTEXT: The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\nTITLE: Results of Operations\nTEXT: We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 8 — Segment Information.”\nTEXT: Macroeconomic factors, including changes in inflation and interest rates, global economic and geopolitical developments, including unpredictable shifts in global tariff and trade policies, and the development and adoption of technologies and services, including artificial intelligence, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to predict, isolate, and quantify. These could affect customer demand for our products and services, our ability to forecast growth needs, expenses, and benefits from new technologies. We expect some or all of them to continue to impact our operations into Q3 2025.\nTEXT: Net sales include product and service sales.

Changes in foreign exchange rates increased cost of sales by $898 million for Q2 2025, but did not significantly impact cost of sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Shipping costs were $22.0 billion and $23.4 billion in Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, and $43.8 billion and $45.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes,\nTEXT: optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nTEXT: Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\nTEXT: Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\nTEXT: The increase in fulfillment costs in Q2 2025 and for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by fulfillment network efficiencies.

We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q2 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, including depreciation and amortization, and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs for the six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, including depreciation and amortization, partially offset by decreased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings.

We provide a free cash flow measure because we believe it provides additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash. Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives.” The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities,” for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025 (in millions):\nTEXT: Twelve Months EndedJune 30, 20242025Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities$107,952 $121,137 Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives(54,979)(102,953)Free cash flow$52,973 $18,184 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(64,354)$(123,569)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities$(21,440)$(8,652)\nTABLE: TABLE: 2024 2025; Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ 107,952 $ 121,137; Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales and incentives (54,979) (102,953); Free cash flow $ 52,973 $ 18,184; Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities $ (64,354) $ (123,569); Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities $ (21,440) $ (8,652).\nTITLE: Twelve Months EndedJune 30,\nTITLE: 20242025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTEXT: Free cash flow has limitations as it omits certain components of the overall cash flow statement and does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate the portion of payments representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTEXT: Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates\nTEXT: Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S. Dollar, on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income is provided to show reported period operating results had the foreign exchange rates remained the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period. The effect on our net sales, operating expenses, and operating income from changes in our foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):\nTEXT: Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,2024202520242025AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)As ReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)AsReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)As ReportedExchangeRateEffect (1)At PriorYearRates (2)Net sales$147,977 $1,041 $149,018 $167,702 $(1,515)$166,187 $291,290 $1,205 $292,495 $323,369 $(75)$323,294 Operating expenses133,305 1,070 134,375 148,531 (1,362)147,169 261,311 1,306 262,617 285,793 131 285,924 Operating income14,672 (29)14,643 19,171 (153)19,018 29,979 (101)29,878 37,576 (206)37,370\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,; 2024 2025 2024 2025; AsReported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2) As Reported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2) AsReported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2) As Reported ExchangeRateEffect (1) At PriorYearRates (2); Net sales $ 147,977 $ 1,041 $ 149,018 $ 167,702 $ (1,515) $ 166,187 $ 291,290 $ 1,205 $ 292,495 $ 323,369 $ (75) $ 323,294; Operating expenses 133,305 1,070 134,375 148,531 (1,362) 147,169 261,311 1,306 262,617 285,793 131 285,924; Operating income 14,672 (29) 14,643 19,171 (153) 19,018 29,979 (101) 29,878 37,576 (206) 37,370.\nTITLE: Three Months Ended June 30,Six Months Ended June 30,\nTITLE: Three Months Ended June 30,\nTITLE: Six Months Ended June 30,\nTITLE: 2024202520242025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: AsReported\nTITLE: ExchangeRateEffect (1)\nTITLE: At PriorYearRates (2)\nTITLE: As Reported\nTITLE: ExchangeRateEffect (1)\nTITLE: At PriorYearRates (2)\nTITLE: AsReported\nTITLE: ExchangeRateEffect (1)\nTITLE: At PriorYearRates (2)\nTITLE: As Reported\nTITLE: ExchangeRateEffect (1)\nTITLE: At PriorYearRates (2)\nTEXT: (1)Represents the change in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.\nTEXT: (2)Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period for operating results.\n"

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of July 31, 2025, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.”\nTEXT: •Net sales are expected to be between $174.0 billion and $179.5 billion, or to grow between 10% and 13% compared with third quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 130 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: •Operating income is expected to be between $15.5 billion and $20.5 billion, compared with $17.4 billion in third quarter 2024.\nTEXT: •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nTITLE: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n"

Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nTEXT: Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nTEXT: During Q2 2025, net sales from our International segment accounted for 22% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q2 2025 increased by $1.7 billion in comparison with Q2 2024.\nTEXT: We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of June 30, 2025, of $19.9 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $995 million, $2.0 billion, and $4.0 billion.\nTEXT: We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of June 30, 2025, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $335 million, $670 million, and $1.3 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nTEXT: See Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $23.2 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.6 billion of our investments as of June 30, 2025, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies, which primarily include our equity investment in Anthropic, for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-for-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\n"
