Chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in 33 separate lawsuits filed by various U.S. cities and counties, five U.S. states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, two Native American tribes, and a trade group in both federal and state courts.1 The lawsuits have asserted various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, fraud, conspiracy to commit fraud, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, unjust enrichment, violations of consumer and environmental protection statutes, violations of unfair competition statutes, violations of a federal antitrust statute, and violations of federal and state RICO statutes, based upon, among other things, the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. Further such proceedings are likely to be brought by other parties. While defendants have sought to remove cases filed in state court to federal court, most of those cases have been remanded to state court and the U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for writ of certiorari on jurisdictional questions to date. The U.S. Supreme Court has also denied petitions for certiorari to review a decision from the Hawaii Supreme Court allowing claims brought by the City and County of Honolulu to proceed past the pleadings. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings include claims for damages (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement, contribution to abatement funds, disgorgement of profits and equitable relief for pollution, impairment and destruction of natural resources, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits. Due to the unprecedented nature of the suits, the company is unable to estimate any range of possible liability, but given the uncertainty of litigation there can be no assurance that the cases will not have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.\n"

Chevron entities are defendants in 37 of these cases.2 The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek remediation damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Further such proceedings may be brought by other parties. Most of these cases have been remanded to Louisiana state court. In April 2025, a jury in a Louisiana state court awarded Plaquemines Parish $744.6 million in a trial against Chevron entities. However, the United States Supreme Court subsequently granted a petition for writ of certiorari in a related case and will determine if certain of these cases belong in federal, rather than state, court. A state court judge then continued a hearing on Plaquemines Parish’s motion for entry of judgment on the trial verdict and stayed that case pending a decision by the United States Supreme Court. The company denies this liability and plans to appeal any judgment based on the jury verdict. The jury’s decision was unique to the facts and circumstances of the case and may not be representative of future outcomes for other claims brought against Chevron entities under the SLCRMA. In accordance with guidance on the evaluation of loss contingencies, the company has recorded an accrual of $131 million, which the company believes to be a reasonably estimable loss in light of the available defenses. It is reasonably possible that the estimate of the loss could change based on the progression of the case, including the appeals process. However, because of the uncertainties associated with ongoing litigation, we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss that may be attributable to liabilities, if any, in excess of the amount accrued. While the company believes the jury verdict is not legally or factually supported and intends to appeal and vigorously pursue post-judgment remedies, there can be no assurances that such defense efforts will be successful. To the extent the company is required to pay remediation damages in these cases, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Management believes that the claims in these lawsuits lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.\n"

The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are reflected in the table above. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts valued using quoted prices from active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent.

During second quarter 2025 and for the six months ended June 30, 2025, the company recognized a fair value loss of $327 million and $95 million, respectively, in “Other income (loss)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The fair value of the Hess stock was $2.3 billion at the close of market on July 17, 2025, the day before Chevron completed the acquisition of Hess, and the company will recognize a gain of $160 million on the investment in the third quarter.

      "content": "ITEM 2:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\ncompany, chevron, energy, corporation, carbon, change, lower, which, climate, emissions\n\nTITLE: Business Environment and Outlook\nTEXT: Chevron Corporation3 is a global energy company with direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates that conduct substantial business activities in the following countries: Angola, Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Guyana, Israel, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Venezuela.\nTEXT: The company’s objective is to safely deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.\nTEXT: Some governments, companies, communities and other stakeholders are supporting efforts to address climate change. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of design, adoption and implementation. These policies and programs, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of jurisdiction-specific policies and programs can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements; the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; evolving regulatory or other requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures and evolving standards and regulations for tracking, reporting, marketing and advertising relating to emissions and emissions reductions and removals.\nTEXT: Significant uncertainty remains as to the pace and extent to which the transition to a lower carbon future will progress, which is dependent, in part, on further advancements and changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. The level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and the amount of additional investments needed in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted, available technology options, customer and consumer preferences, the company’s activities and market conditions. Although the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply for many years to come.\nTEXT: Chevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and continues to take actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the demand for energy. Chevron believes that broad, market-based mechanisms are the most efficient approach to addressing GHG emissions reductions. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as electric vehicle and renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards and demand response to oil and natural gas prices.\nTEXT: 3 Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and “its” may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies generally owned 50 percent or less. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.\n"

At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer and consumer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow new businesses in renewable fuels, carbon capture and offsets, hydrogen, power generation for data centers, and emerging technologies. To grow its new businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets, partnerships and customer relationships. The company’s oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon market, economic, legislative and regulatory forces, among other factors.\nTEXT: Chevron’s previously disclosed 2050 net zero upstream aspiration, GHG intensity targets and planned lower-carbon capital spend through 2028 can be found on pages 36 through 37 of the company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Chevron regularly evaluates its aspirations, targets and goals and expects to change or eliminate some of its aspirations, targets and goals for various reasons, including market conditions; its strategy or portfolio; and financial, operational, policy, reputational, legal and other factors. The company’s ability to achieve any aspiration, target or goal is subject to numerous risks and contingencies, many of which are outside of Chevron’s control. Examples of such risks and contingencies include: (1) sufficient and substantial advances in technology, including the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) laws, governmental regulation, policies, and other enabling actions, including those regarding subsidies, tax and other incentives as well as the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability and acceptability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability-related standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements, including changes to IPCC’s Global Warming Potentials and the U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emissions reductions and removals; (7) customers’ and consumers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations; and (9) successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions with customers, suppliers, partners and governments. Please refer to the risk factors regarding our strategy, aspirations, targets, and disclosures related to environmental, social, and governance matters included on pages 23 through 27 of the company’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is due to the mix effects that are impacted by both the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods. Additional information related to the company’s effective income tax rate is included in Note 10 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: Several years ago, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) issued model rules for a new 15 percent global minimum tax (Pillar Two), and various jurisdictions in which the company operates enacted or are in the process of enacting Pillar Two legislation. Enacted Pillar Two legislation did not have a material impact on our results of operations, and we do not expect it to have a material impact going forward.\nTEXT: On July 4, 2025, the United States enacted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”), which made significant changes to U.S. tax law. We are continuing to evaluate the impact that the OBBBA may have on the company’s future results of operations.\nTEXT: Supply Chain and Inflation Impacts The company is actively managing its contracting, procurement and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and facilitate supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of the company’s operational goals. Third party costs for capital and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market-based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, which may result in a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends.\nTEXT: Trends in the costs of goods and services vary by spend category. Chevron has applied inflation mitigation strategies to temper cost increases, including fixed price and index-based contracts. Lead times for key capital equipment remain long due to strong demand levels. Chevron has addressed equipment cost increases and long lead times by partnering with suppliers on demand planning, volume commitments, standardization, and scope optimization. The offshore market remains competitive for vessels and subsea equipment. In the United States, cost pressures for materials and standard onshore drilling and completion equipment continue to ease.\n"

The tariff impact in 2025 is currently estimated at less than one percent of the company’s third party spend and is not expected to be material to the company’s financial results. The company continues to work with partners across its supply chain to identify alternative sourcing options and mitigate the impact of the tariffs. However, there is significant uncertainty as to the duration and magnitude of these and any future tariffs that may be imposed and, accordingly, as to the resultant impacts these tariffs could have on the company and its suppliers and the company’s future results of operations.\nTEXT: Acquisition and Disposition of Assets The company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. The company is targeting $10-15 billion of asset sales over the five-year period ending in 2028. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods. In addition, some assets are sold along with their related liabilities, such as abandonment and decommissioning obligations. In certain instances, such transferred obligations have reverted, and may in the future revert, to the company and result in losses that could be significant. The company has historically recognized losses and could have additional significant obligations revert, primarily in the United States, but is not currently aware of any such obligations that are reasonably possible to be material. Refer to Note 12 Other Contingencies and Commitments for additional information.\nTEXT: In October 2023, the company announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with Hess. During first quarter 2025, the company purchased approximately 5 percent of the outstanding shares of Hess in open market transactions. The company then acquired the remaining outstanding shares of Hess on July 18, 2025. The company expects the acquisition to have favorable impacts on its future production and free cash flow. In addition, the company anticipates recognizing transaction-related costs, including employee severance and advisor fees, in third quarter 2025. Refer to Note 18 Acquisition of Hess Corporation for additional information.\nTEXT: Other Impacts The company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in commodity prices and downstream margins. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\nTEXT: The company has announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge in fourth quarter 2024, and could incur additional charges in future periods.\nTEXT: Comments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:\nTEXT: Upstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs). These prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\nTEXT: The longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\nTEXT: Chevron has interests in Venezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in Venezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. The financial results for Chevron’s business in Venezuela have been recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received, and production and reserves are not included in the company’s results. Crude oil liftings in Venezuela started in first quarter 2023, which positively impacted the company’s results. Between March 4, 2025, and July 21, 2025, Chevron activities were restricted under applicable general licenses. As of July 21, 2025, Chevron is maintaining its presence in Venezuela consistent with the U.S. government sanctions policy, and pursuant to this policy, expects to deliver a limited amount of crude oil to the U.S. from these affiliates in the third quarter.\n"

An adverse event or incident affecting CPC operations, which CPC has experienced from time to time, could have a negative impact on the Tengiz field and the company’s results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks remain uncertain.\nTEXT: Governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport, and/or export crude in the region around Russia.\nTEXT: Chevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. The conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries has not significantly impacted the company’s operations, with the company continuing to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the potential for further conflict in the region, and any future impacts on the company’s results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\nTEXT: Sources: Platts (crude) & Energy Intelligence (natural gas)\nTEXT: The chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $72 per barrel for the first six months of 2025, compared with $84 per barrel during the first six months of 2024, and ended July at about $73 per barrel. For every dollar change in Brent crude oil prices, the company’s annual after-tax earnings and cash flow sensitivity is approximately $450 million. The WTI price averaged $68 per barrel for the first six months of 2025, compared to $79 per barrel in the first six months of 2024, and ended July at about $69 per barrel.\nTEXT: The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $3.71 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the first six months of 2025, compared with $2.24 per MCF during the first six months of 2024, and ended July at about $2.98 per MCF. See page 39 for the company’s U.S. and international average realizations for the first six months of 2025 and the same period last year.\nTEXT: Crude oil pricing was volatile during second quarter 2025 due to increased geopolitical tensions; however, prices eased relative to the first quarter as a result of a series of announcements by OPEC+ conveying their intent to unwind voluntary production cuts, while non-OPEC+ production continued to grow.\nTEXT: In contrast to price movements in the global market for crude oil, prices for natural gas are more impacted by regional supply and demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, mild spring weather and strong production drove the U.S. natural gas storage levels above the five-year average during second quarter 2025, leading to lower U.S. Henry Hub prices relative to first quarter 2025.\nTEXT: Outside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquified natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG assets is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\nTEXT: Production The company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2025 averaged 3.37 million barrels per day, up 2 percent from a year ago as growth in the Permian Basin, TCO, and the Gulf of America was partly offset by the impacts of asset sales. About 23 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in the first six months of 2025 occurred in the OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, and the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.\nTEXT: Refer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 33 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.\nTEXT: Downstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant\nTEXT: additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\nTEXT: Other factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\nTEXT: The company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas.\nTEXT: Refer to the “Results of Operations” section beginning on page 34 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.\n"

The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of commercial paper, the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $14.7 billion at June 30, 2025, and $12.7 billion at December 31, 2024. Of these amounts, $8.25 billion was reclassified to long-term at both June 30, 2025, and December 31, 2024. At June 30, 2025, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to continually refinance them.\nTEXT: At June 30, 2025, the company had $8.25 billion in 364-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations. The credit facilities allow the company the option to convert outstanding short-term obligations into a term loan for a period of up to one year from the facilities termination date. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facilities would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating. No borrowings were outstanding under these facilities at June 30, 2025. In addition, the company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in November 2027 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.\nTEXT: The major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding bonds issued by Chevron Corporation, CUSA, Texaco Capital Inc. and Noble Energy, Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation (S&P) and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s). The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by S&P and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.\nTEXT: The company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates, and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the flexibility to modify capital spending plans, discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program, sell assets, and increase\nTEXT: borrowings to continue paying the common stock dividend. The company remains committed to retaining high-quality debt ratings.\nTEXT: Summarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries CUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis, and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.\n"

The 2023 Program took effect on April 1, 2023, and does not have a fixed expiration date. In the aggregate, the company has repurchased 214.5 million shares for $32.9 billion under the 2023 Program, including 18.6 million shares repurchased for $2.6 billion in second quarter 2025. This excludes 15.38 million shares of Hess that were purchased for $2.2 billion in first quarter 2025 and cancelled in connection with the closing of the company’s acquisition of Hess. In addition, the company paid $146 million in excise taxes related to 2024 buybacks in second quarter 2025. Chevron expects share repurchases in the third quarter 2025 to be between $2.5-$3.0 billion.\nTEXT: Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors.
