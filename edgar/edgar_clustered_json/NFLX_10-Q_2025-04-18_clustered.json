Therefore, effective in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we are no longer reporting streaming membership metrics, including paid net membership additions (losses), paid memberships at end of period, average paying memberships or average monthly revenue per paying membership.\nTEXT: (2) See the “Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information” section below for additional details on our use of constant currency revenue.\nTEXT: Operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased approximately four percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\nTEXT: Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $558 million as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to a $714 million increase in operating income, driven by a $1,172 million increase in revenues and partially offset by a $286 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to the increase in content amortization. The impact of higher operating income was partially offset by a $130 million decrease in foreign exchange gains and losses and a $41 million increase in the provision for income taxes.\nTITLE: Revenues\nTEXT: We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of March 31, 2025, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $31 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $9 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\nTEXT: We also earn revenues from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live experiences and various other sources.

We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.

Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\nTEXT: As of March 31, 2025, we had $15.1 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\nTEXT: We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 55% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and the Canadian dollar.\nTEXT: Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates and, in particular, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 would have been approximately $311 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2024. See Part I, Item 2, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1,908 million and $1,850 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $201 million and $187 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n"

We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and the gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also designate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt. The gains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense),” net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items. If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in\nTEXT: currencies other than the functional currencies as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, income before income taxes would have been approximately $46 million and $38 million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency exchange contracts and our net investment hedges.\n"
