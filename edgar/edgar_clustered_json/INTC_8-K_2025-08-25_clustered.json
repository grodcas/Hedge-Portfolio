In addition, future disbursements for Secure Enclave are subject to conditions in the underlying program, and the Company may not meet those conditions. Further, the Company’s receipt of funds depends on the availability of appropriations from the legislative branch of the U.S. government and the ability of the executive branch of the U.S. government to obtain funding and support contemplated by the transaction.

Given complexity of the transactions, and the interrelationship with the DFA, the Company’s initial analysis of the financial, tax and accounting implications of the transactions has not been completed, and there could be adverse accounting or other impacts, including the recognition of additional costs or losses, that may materially impact the Company’s reported financial results in future periods.

In converting future grant funding into investments in common stock by the US Government, the transactions make it such that the Company’s business will no longer benefit from the reduced future operating costs made possible by such grant funding. In addition, the Company’s business is highly capital intensive and the Company has a number of other current grant arrangement with government entities, and may seek to pursue such arrangements in the future. It is uncertain whether the transactions may cause other government entities to seek to convert their existing grant arrangements with the Company into equity investments or be unwilling to support the Company with future grants, either of which could limit the Company's access to capital, increase the Company's cost of capital, or increase the Company's future operating costs.

The issuance of shares of common stock to the US Government at a discount to the current market price is dilutive to existing stockholders, and stockholders may suffer significant additional dilution if the conditions to the Warrant are triggered and the Warrant are exercised. •The US Government’s equity position in the Company reduces the voting and other governance rights of stockholders and may limit potential future transactions that may be beneficial to stockholders. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement may result in the US Government becoming the Company’s largest stockholder. The US Government’s interests in the Company may not be the same as those of other stockholders. The Purchase Agreement requires the US Government to vote its shares of common stock as recommended by the Company’s board of directors, subject to applicable law and exceptions to protect the US Government’s interests. This will reduce the voting influence of other stockholders with respect to the selection of directors of the Company and proposals voted on by stockholders. The existence of a significant US Government equity interest in the Company, the voting of such shares either as directed by the Company’s board of directors or the US Government, and the US Government’s substantial additional powers with respect to the laws and regulations impacting the Company, may substantially limit the Company's ability to pursue potential future strategic transactions that may be beneficial to stockholders, including by potentially limiting the willingness of other third parties to engage in such potential strategic transactions with the Company.

Sales outside the US accounted for 76% of the Company’s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. Having the US Government as a significant stockholder of the Company could subject the Company to additional regulations, obligations or restrictions, such as foreign subsidy laws or otherwise, in other countries.
