Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters, which management believes should be disclosed.\nTEXT: State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.\nTEXT: Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.\nTEXT: While the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.\n"

In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. Commodity contracts held for trading purposes are presented in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income on a net basis in the line “Sales and other operating revenue\" and in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in “Cash Flows from Operating Activities”. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, or results of operations for the periods ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\nTEXT: The Corporation operates a program to hedge certain of its fixed-rate debt instruments against changes in fair value due to changes in the designated benchmark interest rate. This program utilizes fair value hedge accounting. The derivative (hedging) instruments are fixed-for-floating interest rate swaps, with settlement dates that correspond to the interest payments associated with the fixed-rate debt (hedged item).

Natural gas prices improved during the quarter and moved above the 10-year range on stronger global demand, driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe. Global industry refining margins declined and moved below the low end of the 10-year range, driven by weakness in Asia Pacific from capacity additions and higher regional feed costs. The Corporation benefited from its relatively large refining footprint in North America where industry margins improved as a result of turnarounds and industry outages. Chemical margins remained at bottom of cycle conditions, and well below the 10-year range, as growing demand was met by continued capacity additions.\nTEXT: During 2025, the U.S. announced a variety of trade-related actions, including the imposition of tariffs on imports from several countries. In response, many countries announced their own retaliatory tariffs. Certain tariffs were paused for a period of time but have not been withdrawn. The global trade environment continues to be volatile. The likelihood of the U.S. or its trading partners resuming tariffs, imposing new or reciprocal tariffs, export restrictions, or other forms of trade-related sanctions is highly uncertain. Additionally, significant uncertainty exists as to what effects these actions will ultimately have on the Corporation, our suppliers and our customers, as well as on the overall macroeconomic environment. We continually monitor the global trade environment and work to mitigate potential impacts.\nTITLE: Selected Earnings Driver Definitions\nTEXT: The earnings drivers provide additional visibility into our business results. The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth. Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products.\nTEXT: •Advantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects). Includes Permian, Guyana, and LNG.\nTEXT: •Advantaged Projects. Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns.\nTEXT: •High-Value Products. Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nTEXT: Base Volume. Represents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\nTEXT: Structural Cost Savings. Represents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on page 19, including cash operating expenses related to divestments.\nTEXT: Expenses. Represents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\nTEXT: Timing Effects. Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n"

Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $12.7 billion, which included an additional $0.6 billion in the first three months of 2025. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Structural Cost Savings from new operations, mergers and acquisitions, and new business venture developments are included in the cumulative Structural Cost Savings. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation's efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.\nTEXT: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted)Twelve MonthsEnded December 31,Three Months EndedMarch 31,2019202420242025Components of Operating CostsFrom ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income(U.S. GAAP)Production and manufacturing expenses36.8 39.6 9.1 10.1 Selling, general and administrative expenses11.4 10.0 2.5 2.5 Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments)19.0 23.4 4.8 5.7 Exploration expenses, including dry holes1.3 0.8 0.1 0.1 Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense1.2 0.1 — 0.1 Subtotal69.7 74.0 16.5 18.5 ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP)9.1 9.6 2.4 2.6 Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1 Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1 Less:Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments)19.0 23.4 4.8 5.7 Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense1.2 0.1 — 0.1 Other adjustments (includes equity company depreciation and depletion)3.6 3.7 0.9 1.3 Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)55.0 56.4 13.2 14.1 Energy and production taxes (Non-GAAP)11.0 13.9 3.4 3.9 Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)44.0 42.5 9.8 10.2 Change vs 2019Change vs 2024Estimated Cumulative vs 2019Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)-1.5+0.4Market+4.0+0.0Activity / Other+6.6+1.0Structural Cost Savings-12.1-0.6-12.7Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\nTABLE: TABLE: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted) Twelve MonthsEnded December 31, Three Months EndedMarch 31,; 2019 2024 2024 2025; Production and manufacturing expenses 36.8 39.6 9.1 10.1; Selling, general and administrative expenses 11.4 10.0 2.5 2.5; Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments) 19.0 23.4 4.8 5.7; Exploration expenses, including dry holes 1.3 0.8 0.1 0.1; Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense 1.2 0.1 — 0.1; Subtotal 69.7 74.0 16.5 18.5; ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP) 9.1 9.6 2.4 2.6; Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP) 78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1; Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP) 78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1; Depreciation and depletion (includes impairments) 19.0 23.4 4.8 5.7; Non-service pension and postretirement benefit expense 1.2 0.1 — 0.1; Other adjustments (includes equity company depreciation and depletion) 3.6 3.7 0.9 1.3; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP) 55.0 56.4 13.2 14.1; Energy and production taxes (Non-GAAP) 11.0 13.9 3.4 3.9; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP) 44.0 42.5 9.8 10.2; Change vs 2019 Change vs 2024 Estimated Cumulative vs 2019; Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP) -1.5 +0.4; Market +4.0 +0.0; Activity / Other +6.6 +1.0; Structural Cost Savings -12.1 -0.6 -12.7.\nTEXT: Dollars in billions (unless otherwise noted)\nTITLE: Components of Operating Costs\nTITLE: From ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income(U.S. GAAP)\nTITLE: Subtotal69.7 74.0 16.5 18.5\nTITLE: Subtotal\nTITLE: 69.7\nTITLE: 74.0\nTITLE: 16.5\nTITLE: 18.5\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 78.8\nTITLE: 83.6\nTITLE: 18.9\nTITLE: 21.1\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)78.8 83.6 18.9 21.1\nTITLE: Total Adjusted Operating Costs (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 78.8\nTITLE: 83.6\nTITLE: 18.9\nTITLE: 21.1\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)55.0 56.4 13.2 14.1\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 55.0\nTITLE: 56.4\nTITLE: 13.2\nTITLE: 14.1\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)44.0 42.5 9.8 10.2\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: 44.0\nTITLE: 42.5\nTITLE: 9.8\nTITLE: 10.2\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)-1.5+0.4\nTITLE: Total Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings-12.1-0.6-12.7\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings\nTITLE: -12.1\nTITLE: -0.6\nTITLE: -12.7\nTEXT: Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n"

The decrease in earnings was mainly driven by a significant decline in industry refining margins, weaker crude prices, lower base volumes from divestments, and higher expenses driven by growth initiatives, partly offset by increased volumes from advantaged Upstream investments in the Permian and Guyana, favorable timing effects from derivatives mark-to-market impacts and Structural Cost Savings.

These drivers consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\nTEXT: Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining drivers. These drivers include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such drivers can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\nTEXT: Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.\nTEXT: Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\nTEXT: Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational drivers not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such drivers include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.\nTITLE: ENERGY PRODUCTS\nTEXT: Energy Products Financial Results(millions of dollars)Three Months EndedMarch 31,20252024Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)United States297 836 Non-U.S.530 540 Total827 1,376 Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)United States297 836 Non-U.S.530 540 Total827 1,376 (1) Refer to page 18 for definition of Identified Items and earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items.\nTABLE: TABLE: (millions of dollars) Three Months EndedMarch 31,; 2025 2024; United States 297 836; Non-U.S. 530 540; Total 827 1,376; United States 297 836; Non-U.S. 530 540; Total 827 1,376.\nTITLE: Energy Products Financial Results\nTITLE: (millions of dollars)Three Months EndedMarch 31,\nTITLE: Three Months EndedMarch 31,\nTITLE: 20252024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\nTITLE: Total827 1,376\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 827\nTITLE: 1,376\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: Total827 1,376\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 827\nTITLE: 1,376\nTEXT: (1) Refer to page 18 for definition of Identified Items and earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items.\nTITLE: Energy Products First Quarter Earnings Driver Analysis(millions of dollars)\nTABLE: TABLE: .\nTITLE: Energy Products First Quarter Earnings Driver Analysis(millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Energy Products First Quarter Earnings Driver Analysis\nTEXT: Margin – Industry refining margins decreased earnings by $1,290 million, normalizing from historically high levels.\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth – Higher volumes from advantaged projects increased earnings by $10 million.\nTEXT: Base Volume – Lower base volumes decreased earnings by $70 million.\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $110 million.\n"

Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations.

The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company’s Global Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly.

Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders.
