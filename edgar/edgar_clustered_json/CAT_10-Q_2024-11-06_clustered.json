We recognize trade receivables from dealers and end users in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade and other in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,798 million, $7,923 million and $7,551 million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.

We recognize a contract asset when a sale is recognized before achieving the contractual milestones for invoicing. We reduce the contract asset when we invoice for payment and recognize a corresponding trade receivable. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. Contract assets were $218 million, $246 million and $247 million as of September 30, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nTEXT: We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products.

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized $197 million and $1,333 million, respectively.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $14.1 billion, with about one-half of the amount expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following September 30, 2024. We have elected the practical expedient not to disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.\nTEXT: See Note 16 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.\nTITLE: 4.

Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, commodity price and certain deferred compensation plan liability exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity forward and option contracts and total return swap contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. We present at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on our risk management practices, including our use of financial derivative instruments.\nTEXT: We recognize all derivatives at their fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow.\nTEXT: We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\nTEXT: We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\nTEXT: Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\nTEXT: We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities.\n"

Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nTEXT: We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products. We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.\nTEXT: Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\nTEXT: Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: Deferred Compensation Plan Liability Risk\nTEXT: We are also exposed to variability in compensation expense related to certain non-qualified deferred compensation obligations to employees.

Under the guarantees, non-performance by the third-parties could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligation by providing goods, services or financial compensation. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts possibly recoverable) that we could be required to make under the guarantees was $406 million and $353 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nTEXT: We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.\nTEXT: No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the SPC’s assets of $1.31 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1.31 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat\nTEXT: Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\nTEXT: We determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.

      "content": "ITEM 1:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nthese, operating, laws, chief, officer, other, costs, material, group, will\n\nTITLE: Environmental and legal matters\nTEXT: The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\nTEXT: We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\nTEXT: In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTEXT: Our operations in Brazil are subject to highly complex labor, tax, customs and other laws. While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws, we are periodically engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws, including certain tax and customs disputes with federal, state and municipal authorities in Brazil relating to export activities associated with Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential losses; however, we currently believe that any matters raised will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTITLE: 15. Income taxes\nTITLE: Income taxes\nTEXT: The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 20.7 percent compared to 20.9 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 21.4 percent compared to 22.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nTITLE: 16. Segment information\nTITLE: Segment information\nTITLE: A. Basis for segment information\nTEXT: Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The COO, Group Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the COO/Group President/CFO level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker, and operating segments are primarily based on the COO/Group President/CFO reporting structure.\nTEXT: Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads one smaller operating segment that is included in the All Other Segment. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.\n"

Segment measurement and reconciliations\nTEXT: There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:\nTEXT: •ME&T segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. We generally manage at the corporate level liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances, and we do not include these in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\nTEXT: •We value segment inventories and cost of sales using a current cost methodology.\nTEXT: •We amortize goodwill allocated to segments using a fixed amount based on a 20-year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.\nTEXT: •We generally manage currency exposures for ME&T at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.\nTEXT: •Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We determine ME&T segment profit on a pretax basis and exclude interest expense and most other income/expense items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income/expense items.\nTEXT: Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 32 to 33 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\nTEXT: •Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.\nTEXT: •Restructuring income/costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 20 for more information.\nTEXT: •Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: •Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, we report certain costs on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.\n"

Cat Financial financing activities\nTITLE: Cat Financial financing activities\nTITLE: Allowance for credit losses\nTITLE: Portfolio segments\nTEXT: A portfolio segment is the level at which Cat Financial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Cat Financial's portfolio segments and related methods for estimating expected credit losses are as follows:\nTITLE: Customer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides loans and finance leases to end-user customers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used Caterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use. Cat Financial also provides financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial's customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 51 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of September 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\nTEXT: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Cat Financial's forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as low delinquencies within their portfolio. However, industry delinquencies show an increasing trend as the central bank actions aimed at reducing inflation have weakened global economic growth. The company believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\nTITLE: Dealer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTEXT: In general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.\nTITLE: Classes of finance receivables\nTEXT: Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\nTITLE: •North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\nTITLE: •EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia.\nTITLE: •Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\nTITLE: •Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.\n"

Typically, the types of modifications granted are payment deferrals, interest-only payment periods and/or term extensions. Many modifications Cat Financial grants are for commercial reasons or for borrowers experiencing some form of short-term financial stress and may result in insignificant payment delays. Cat Financial does not consider these borrowers to be experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications for borrowers Cat Financial does consider to be experiencing financial difficulty typically result in payment deferrals and/or reduced payments for a period of four months or longer, term extension of six months or longer or a combination of both.\nTEXT: During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no finance receivable modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the Customer portfolio segment during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $6 million and $13 million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented 0.03 percent and 0.06 percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the Customer portfolio segment during the nine months\nTEXT: ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was $12 million and $38 million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented 0.05 percent and 0.17 percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively.\nTEXT: For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of 5 and 8 months, respectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of term extensions for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty added a weighted average of 8 and 17 months, respectively, to the terms of modified contracts. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average payment deferrals and/or interest only payment periods of 4 and 6 months, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the financial effects of payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty resulted in weighted average payment deferrals and/or interest only payment periods of 6 and 7 months, respectively.\nTEXT: After Cat Financial modifies a finance receivable, they continue to track its performance under its most recent modified terms. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, defaults of loans modified in the prior twelve months were not significant.\nTEXT: The effect of most modifications made to finance receivables for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses based on the methodologies used to estimate the allowance; therefore, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. On rare occasions when principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is written off against the allowance for credit losses.\nTITLE: 18. Fair value disclosures\nTITLE: Fair value disclosures\nTITLE: A. Fair value measurements\nTITLE: Fair value measurements\nTEXT: The guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\n"

In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3.\nTEXT: We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. We may therefore classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nTEXT: Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\nTEXT: Investments in debt and equity securities\nTEXT: We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: We also have investments in time deposits classified as held-to-maturity debt securities. The fair value of these investments is based upon valuations observed in less active markets than Level 1. These investments have a maturity of less than one year and are recorded at amortized costs, which approximate fair value.\nTEXT: In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: See Note 8 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\nTEXT: Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. The fair value of total return swap contracts is primarily based on valuing the underlying securities or funds using pricing by industry providers and the average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread.\nTEXT: See Note 5 for additional information.\nTEXT: Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value included in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nTEXT: September 30, 2024 (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair ValueAssets Debt securities Government debt securities U.S. treasury bonds$13 $— $— $— $13 Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds— 69 — — 69 Corporate debt securities Corporate bonds and other debt securities— 2,950 — — 2,950 Asset-backed securities— 220 — — 220 Mortgage-backed debt securities U.S. governmental agency— 444 — — 444 Residential— 2 — — 2 Commercial— 128 — — 128 Total debt securities13 3,813 — — 3,826 Equity securities Large capitalization value266 — — — 266 Smaller company growth39 — — — 39 REIT— — — 168 168 Total equity securities305 — — 168 473 Derivative financial instruments - assetsForeign currency contracts - net— 161 — — 161 Commodity contracts - net— 7 — — 7 Total return swap contracts - net— 16 — — 16 Total assets$318 $3,997 $— $168 $4,483 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - liabilitiesInterest rate contracts - net$— $77 $— $— $77 Total liabilities$— $77 $— $— $77\n"

A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had loans carried at fair value of $59 million and $55 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\n"

In North America, we anticipate lower sales of equipment to end users in the fourth quarter of 2024 primarily due to lower rental fleet loading, consistent with the trend in the second and third quarters of 2024. However, dealer rental revenue continues to grow. In addition, government-related infrastructure projects are expected to remain healthy, supported by funding yet to be spent from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect soft economic conditions to continue. We anticipate demand in China will remain at a relatively low level in the excavator industry above 10-tons. In EAME, we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue, to be partially offset by continued healthy construction demand in the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America remains healthy, and we are expecting modest growth to continue. In addition, we anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries.\nTEXT: In Resource Industries, for both mining and heavy construction and quarry and aggregates, we continue to anticipate lower machine sales volume in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to a strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, we expect the year-over-year rate of decline for sales of equipment to end users to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to previous quarters. We expect higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains relatively low, the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to have strong customer acceptance. Customers continue to display capital discipline, however, we continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nTEXT: In Energy & Transportation, Power Generation demand is expected to remain strong, and we expect robust growth for reciprocating engines and for turbines and turbine-related services in the fourth quarter of 2024 and for the full-year as compared to 2023. Overall strength in Power Generation continues to be driven by data center growth related to cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence (AI), and we expect this trend to continue. For Oil & Gas, in total, we expect a stronger year overall in 2024 as compared to 2023. For turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil & Gas applications, we expect a strong fourth quarter of 2024, but sales are expected to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2023 due to the timing of deliveries. We expect the increase in sales for turbines and turbine-related services used in Power Generation will mostly offset the decrease in sales for turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil & Gas. Overall, we expect roughly flat sales in turbines and turbine-related services in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. Turbines and turbine-related services has a strong backlog as well as healthy order and inquiry activity, and we continue to expect growth for turbines and turbine-related services in Oil & Gas in 2024 as compared to 2023. After a strong 2023, we expect reciprocating engine sales for Oil & Gas to be slightly down in 2024, primarily due to ongoing softness in well servicing. We still expect gas compression for reciprocating engines used in Oil & Gas to be up in 2024 as compared to 2023, however, we expect it to soften in the near-term as equipment lead times have normalized. Industrial demand is expected to remain at a relatively low level in 2024 as compared to 2023. In Transportation, we anticipate growth in 2024 for both rail services and marine applications.\nTEXT: Fourth-Quarter 2024 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expect slightly lower total sales and revenues as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, impacted by lower machine sales of equipment to end users. Machine dealer inventory is expected to decrease less during the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the $1.4 billion decrease during the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect machine dealer inventory at the end of 2024 to be around the same level as the end of 2023. Price realization for machines is expected to trend lower with the normalizing pricing environment, partially offset by favorable price realization in Energy & Transportation. Services revenues increased in the third quarter of 2024, and the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives are expected to positively impact sales in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect favorable manufacturing costs and lower selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and development (R&D) expenses to be more than offset by the profit impact of lower sales volume. Lower SG&A/R&D expenses are expected to be primarily driven by lower short-term incentive compensation in the fourth quarter of 2024 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n"

There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTITLE: OTHER MATTERS\nTEXT: Information related to legal proceedings appears in Note 14 – \"Environmental and legal matters\" of Part I, Item 1 “Financial Statements.”\nTITLE: Retirement Benefits\nTEXT: We recognize mark-to-market gains and losses immediately through earnings upon the remeasurement of our pension and OPEB plans. Mark-to-market gains and losses represent the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions. We will record the annual mark-to-market adjustment as of the measurement date, December 31, 2024. It is difficult to predict the December 31, 2024 adjustment amount, as it will be dependent primarily on changes in discount rates during 2024, and actual returns on plan assets differing from our expected returns for 2024.\nTITLE: Order Backlog\nTEXT: At the end of the third quarter of 2024, the dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately $28.7 billion, about $0.1 billion higher than the second quarter of 2024. The order backlog increased in Energy & Transportation, while Construction Industries and Resource Industries decreased. Of the total backlog at September 30, 2024, approximately $6.8 billion was not expected to be filled in the following twelve months.\n"

These non-GAAP financial measures have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar measures for other companies. Management does not intend these items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures.\nTEXT: We believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact of four significant items in order for our results to be meaningful to our readers. These items consist of (i) restructuring income/costs related to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities in 2024, (ii) other restructuring income/costs, (iii) restructuring costs related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 and (iv) certain deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments in 2023. We do not consider these items indicative of earnings from ongoing business activities and believe the non-GAAP measure provides investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing our period-over-period results.\nTEXT: Reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are as follows:\nTEXT: (Dollars in millions except per share data)Operating ProfitOperating Profit MarginProfit Before TaxesProvision (Benefit) for Income TaxesProfitProfit per ShareThree Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$3,147 19.5 %$3,098 $642 $2,464 $5.06 Other restructuring (income) costs70 0.5 %70 16 54 0.11 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted$3,217 20.0 %$3,168 $658 $2,518 $5.17 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$3,449 20.5 %$3,515 $734 $2,794 $5.45 Other restructuring (income) costs46 0.3 %46 10 36 0.07 Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - Adjusted$3,495 20.8 %$3,561 $744 $2,830 $5.52 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$10,148 20.9 %$10,130 $2,166 $8,001 $16.27 Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities164 0.3 %164 54 110 0.22 Other restructuring (income) costs158 0.3 %158 36 122 0.26 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted$10,470 21.5 %$10,452 $2,256 $8,233 $16.75 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$9,832 19.7 %$9,801 $2,194 $7,659 $14.85 Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture586 1.2 %586 — 586 1.13 Other restructuring (income) costs102 0.1 %102 21 81 0.17 Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments— — %— 88 (88)(0.17)Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - Adjusted$10,520 21.0 %$10,489 $2,303 $8,238 $15.98\nTABLE: TABLE: (Dollars in millions except per share data) Operating Profit Operating Profit Margin Profit Before Taxes Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Profit Profit per Share; Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP $ 3,147 19.5 % $ 3,098 $ 642 $ 2,464 $ 5.06; Other restructuring (income) costs 70 0.5 % 70 16 54 0.11; Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted $ 3,217 20.0 % $ 3,168 $ 658 $ 2,518 $ 5.17; Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP $ 3,449 20.5 % $ 3,515 $ 734 $ 2,794 $ 5.45; Other restructuring (income) costs 46 0.3 % 46 10 36 0.07; Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - Adjusted $ 3,495 20.8 % $ 3,561 $ 744 $ 2,830 $ 5.52; Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP $ 10,148 20.9 % $ 10,130 $ 2,166 $ 8,001 $ 16.27; Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities 164 0.3 % 164 54 110 0.22; Other restructuring (income) costs 158 0.3 % 158 36 122 0.26; Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted $ 10,470 21.5 % $ 10,452 $ 2,256 $ 8,233 $ 16.75; Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP $ 9,832 19.7 % $ 9,801 $ 2,194 $ 7,659 $ 14.85; Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture 586 1.2 % 586 — 586 1.13; Other restructuring (income) costs 102 0.1 % 102 21 81 0.17; Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments — — % — 88 (88) (0.17); Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - Adjusted $ 10,520 21.0 % $ 10,489 $ 2,303 $ 8,238 $ 15.98.\nTITLE: (Dollars in millions except per share data)\nTITLE: Operating Profit\nTITLE: Operating Profit Margin\nTITLE: Profit Before Taxes\nTITLE: Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nTITLE: Profit\nTITLE: Profit per Share\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$3,147 19.5 %$3,098 $642 $2,464 $5.06\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,147\nTITLE: 19.5\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,098\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 642\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,464\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5.06\nTEXT: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$3,449 20.5 %$3,515 $734 $2,794 $5.45\nTITLE: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,449\nTITLE: 20.5\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,515\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 734\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,794\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5.45\nTEXT: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 - Adjusted\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$10,148 20.9 %$10,130 $2,166 $8,001 $16.27\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 10,148\nTITLE: 20.9\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 10,130\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,166\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 8,001\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 16.27\nTEXT: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 - Adjusted\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$9,832 19.7 %$9,801 $2,194 $7,659 $14.85\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,832\nTITLE: 19.7\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,801\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,194\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 7,659\nTITLE: $\n"
