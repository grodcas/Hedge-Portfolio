General The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire” or “Company”) consolidated with the accounts of all its subsidiaries and affiliates in which Berkshire holds controlling financial interests as of the financial statement date. In these notes, the terms “us,” “we” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Berkshire’s most recently issued Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Annual Report”), which includes information necessary or useful to understanding Berkshire’s businesses and financial statement presentations. Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Given the size of our equity security investment portfolio, changes in market prices and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses on equity securities will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.Significant estimates are used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, including those associated with evaluations of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimation of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts.

Investments in equity securitiesIn 2019, we invested $10 billion in non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and in Occidental common stock warrants. During 2022, we began acquiring common stock of Occidental. Our aggregate voting interest in Occidental common stock exceeded 20% on August 4, 2022, and we adopted the equity method as of that date. See Note 6. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value within commercial, industrial and other in the preceding tables. Such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP and are not eligible for the equity method.The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. As of September 30, 2024, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion, which reflected mandatory redemptions by Occidental during 2023 of approximately $1.5 billion. The Occidental common stock warrants allow us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. On September 30, 2024, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 21.5% of its outstanding common stock. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value.\nTITLE: Carrying Value Fair Value\nTITLE: Carrying Value\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\nTITLE: December 31, 2023\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\n"

The increase in 2024 reflected higher projected claim losses for certain commercial auto, business owner and other casualty business, partly offset by lower than expected private passenger auto and medical professional liability losses. The reduction in liabilities in 2023 was driven by lower than expected private passenger auto losses. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our reinsurance businesses declined $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, mostly attributable to lower than expected property losses, and $1.5 billion in 2023 attributable to reductions in both property and casualty losses.\nTITLE: 2024 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTEXT: Balance at the beginning of the year\nTEXT: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses:\nTEXT: Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses\nTEXT: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses\nTEXT: Deferred charge amortization and adjustments\nTEXT: Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings\nTEXT: In the preceding table, the classification of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses is based on the contract inception dates, which reflect when our exposure to losses began.

Notes payable and other borrowings Berkshire parent company borrowings consist of senior unsecured debt. In the first nine months of 2024, Berkshire repaid approximately $1.9 billion of maturing senior notes. In April 2024, Berkshire issued ¥263.3 billion (approximately $1.7 billion) of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 0.974% to 2.498% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054. In September 2024, Berkshire borrowed ¥142.5 billion (approximately $1.0 billion) under a term loan agreement due in 2028 and with an interest rate of 1.25%. In October 2024, Berkshire issued ¥281.8 billion (approximately $1.85 billion) of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 1.031% to 2.625% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054.Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $2.7 billion at September 30, 2024. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€5.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥1,556 billion par at September 30, 2024) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax losses of $1.5 billion in the third quarter and $136 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to pre-tax gains of $582 million in the third quarter and $1.1 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions). The weighted average interest rates and maturity date ranges are based on borrowings as of September 30, 2024.

Substantially all of the assets of certain BHE subsidiaries are, or may be, pledged or encumbered to support or otherwise secure such debt. These borrowing arrangements generally contain various covenants, including covenants which pertain to leverage ratios, interest coverage ratios and/or debt service coverage ratios. In the first nine months of 2024, BHE subsidiaries issued $5.4 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2055 and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt and short-term borrowings aggregating approximately $4.4 billion. In October 2024, a BHE subsidiary issued $900 million of 5.6% senior notes due in 2054.At December 31, 2023, Pilot’s borrowings primarily represented secured syndicated loans. In March 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries, which Pilot used to repay its then outstanding third-party borrowings. BNSF’s borrowings are primarily senior unsecured debentures. In the first nine months of 2024, BNSF issued $1.3 billion of 5.5% debentures due in 2055 and repaid $1.2 billion of maturing debentures.

Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.\nTITLE: Unrealizedgains (losses) on investments\nTITLE: Foreign currency translation\nTITLE: Long-duration insurance contracts\nTITLE: Defined benefit pension plans\nTITLE: Other\nTITLE: Total\nTEXT: Balance at the beginning of the year\nTEXT: Balance at the end of the period\nTEXT: Balance at the beginning of the year\nTEXT: Balance at the end of the period\nTITLE: First Nine Months\nTITLE: 2024 2023\nTITLE: 2024\n"

Contingencies and commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. PacifiCorp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), operates as a regulated electric utility in Oregon and other Western states. HomeServices of America, Inc. is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHE. Certain legal matters related to these entities are described below. PacifiCorp In September 2020, a severe weather event resulting in high winds, low humidity and warm temperatures, contributed to several major wildfires, which resulted in real and personal property and natural resource damage, personal injuries and loss of life and widespread power outages in Oregon and Northern California. These wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate. Third-party reports for these wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”) indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several other structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, a wildfire began on July 29, 2022, in the Oak Knoll Ranger District of the Klamath National Forest in Siskiyou County, California located in PacifiCorp’s service territory (the “2022 Wildfire”) burning over 60,000 acres. Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 Wildfire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities. The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire, together, are referred to as the “Wildfires”.Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Forest Service, the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry, the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp. As of the date of this filing, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims related to the Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice have informed PacifiCorp that they are contemplating filing actions against PacifiCorp in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims through alternative dispute resolution.As of September 30, 2024, amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximated $3 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek $46 billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. Based on available information to date, we believe it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes.\nTITLE: Manufacturing McLane ServiceandRetailing BNSF BerkshireHathawayEnergy Pilot Insurance,Corporateand other Total\nTITLE: Manufacturing\nTITLE: McLane\nTITLE: ServiceandRetailing\nTITLE: BNSF\nTITLE: BerkshireHathawayEnergy\nTITLE: Pilot\nTITLE: Insurance,Corporateand other\n"

We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nTEXT: Our periodic operating results may be affected in future periods due to impacts of ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these factors or events on our businesses.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings decreased $1.7 billion in the third quarter and increased $1.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by estimated losses from Hurricane Helene ($565 million), increases in liabilities for prior accident years’ claims, unrealized foreign currency exchange losses and accruals in connection with a bankruptcy settlement agreement related to a non-insurance affiliate. Earnings in the first nine months of 2024 benefited from improved operating results at GEICO. In the first nine months of 2023, after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events were approximately $465 million. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.2 billion in the third quarter and $2.8 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, driven by higher interest income from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF increased 13.3% in the third quarter and were relatively unchanged in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Earnings in 2024 benefited from higher unit volume, improvements in employee productivity and lower other operating costs, and were negatively affected by higher litigation charges. After-tax earnings of BHE increased $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $1.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The earnings increases reflected comparative declines in litigation-related charges affecting the U.S. utilities and higher earnings from natural gas pipelines, including reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nTEXT: As disclosed in Note 3 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, we increased our ownership in Pilot from 38.6% to 80% on January 31, 2023, and further increased our ownership to 100% on January 16, 2024. We began consolidating Pilot’s results of operations on February 1, 2023. For the month ended January 31, 2023, earnings from Pilot on our 38.6% interest were determined under the equity method and were included in earnings from non-controlled businesses in the preceding table.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 5.9% in the third quarter and 3.5% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023.

We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment gains in the first nine months of 2023 also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method.\nTEXT: Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate losses of $1.1 billion in the third quarter and $98 million in the first nine months of 2024 and gains of $447 million in the third quarter and $895 million in the first nine months of 2023 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: Our management views our insurance business as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our overall insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.\nTEXT: The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our property and casualty reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in the first nine months of 2024 included Hurricane Helene in the third quarter, while significant events in 2023 included a cyclone and floods in New Zealand in the first quarter. In October 2024, Hurricane Milton struck Florida and caused significant damage. We currently estimate that pre-tax incurred losses from Hurricane Milton could be between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion. Losses from this event will be reflected in our fourth quarter earnings based on information available at that time.\nTEXT: Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results.\nTEXT: We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). We strive to produce pre-tax underwriting earnings (defined as premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except in our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity policies. We normally receive premiums at the contract inception date, which are then available for investment. Ultimate claim payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods through deferred charge asset amortization and accretion of discounted liabilities.\nTEXT: Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months; 2024 2023 2024 2023; GEICO $ 2,033 $ 1,053 $ 5,747 $ 2,270; Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (689 ) 510 76 1,050; Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (310 ) 1,437 1,384 2,495; Pre-tax underwriting earnings 1,034 3,000 7,207 5,815; Income taxes 284 578 1,596 1,235; Net underwriting earnings $ 750 $ 2,422 $ 5,611 $ 4,580; Effective income tax rate 27.5 % 19.2 % 22.1 % 21.2 %.\nTITLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months\nTITLE: Third Quarter\nTITLE: First Nine Months\nTITLE: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\n"

The rate of decline in policies-in-force slowed in the first half of 2024, with growth experienced in the third quarter driven by increased new business and stable retention rates.

The loss ratio declines reflected the impact of higher average earned premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities and less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates.\nTEXT: Claims frequencies in 2024 declined for property damage (two to three percent range) and collision coverages (eight to nine percent range) versus 2023, with bodily injury coverage down slightly. Average claims severities in 2024 increased for property damage (five to seven percent range), collision (four to six percent range) and bodily injury (eight to ten percent range) coverages compared to 2023. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the first nine months included reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims of $339 million in 2024 and $1.2 billion in 2023. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the third quarter of 2024 from Hurricane Helene were approximately $260 million.\nTEXT: Underwriting expenses were relatively flat in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) in the first nine months of 2024 was 9.1%, a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to 2023, attributable to improved operating efficiencies and increased operating leverage, partially offset by increased advertising expenses.

The increases at NICO Primary and BHHC were primarily attributable to commercial auto coverage while the increase at BH Direct reflected growth across several product lines. The decline in premium volumes at GUARD were as a result of new management’s decision to exit admitted homeowners business and to tighten underwriting guidelines in other lines of business.

In 2023, estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior accident years were reduced $219 million in the third quarter and $396 million in the first nine months. A significant portion of the increases in 2024 were related to GUARD. As a result of deteriorating loss experience, new management performed a comprehensive review of claims and, as a result, increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Excluding GUARD, development of estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior accident years in the first nine months were less favorable or were unfavorable in 2024 across several of our businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, attributable to unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of increased jury awards and litigation costs. Incurred losses from Hurricane Helene in the third quarter of 2024 were approximately $80 million, while losses from significant catastrophe events were approximately $35 million in the first nine months of 2023.

In 2023 and through the first nine months of 2024, prices for new business were at unacceptable levels and we wrote no new business in either period.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts in each period were attributable to the accretion of time-value discounted liabilities, including liabilities for contracts without life contingencies, and to foreign currency exchange gains and losses on non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produced pre-tax losses of $96 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to $27 million in 2023. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency effects in the first nine months were $447 million in 2024 and $439 million in 2023. Discounted periodic payment annuity liabilities were $15.1 billion at September 30, 2024, including liabilities of $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies, as well as the effects of the quarterly discount rate changes on contracts with life-contingent liabilities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nTEXT: Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax losses of $75 million in the third quarter and earnings of $30 million in the first nine months of 2024. Pre-tax earnings were $116 million in the third quarter and $309 million in the first nine months of 2023. Earnings are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Average revenue per car/unit declined 5.2% in the third quarter and 6.3% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, resulting from lower fuel surcharge revenue and business mix changes. Car/unit volumes increased 8.3% in the third quarter and 6.4% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax earnings increased 14.8% in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Railroad operating earnings in the first nine months of 2024 increased as a result of volume growth, improved productivity, and lower operating costs, partially offset by increased litigation accruals.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products were $2.1 billion in the third quarter and $6.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, increases of 7.0% and 8.2%, respectively, from 2023. The revenue increases were attributable to higher volumes of 16.7% in the third quarter and 16.9% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increases were primarily due to higher intermodal shipments from west coast imports and volumes from a new intermodal customer.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, decreases of 1.6% and 1.1%, respectively, from 2023. The revenue declines were attributable to lower volumes of 1.9% and 1.2% in the third quarter and the first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to 2023, partially offset by slightly higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were primarily attributable to lower aggregates, taconite, minerals, and waste shipments, partially offset by higher volumes in petroleum products.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products were $1.4 billion in the third quarter and $4.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, increases of 14.1% and 6.5%, respectively, compared to 2023. The revenue increases were attributable to higher volumes of 14.9% in the third quarter and 9.6% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase during the third quarter was primarily due to higher volumes of grain shipments. The volume increase during the first nine months was primarily due to higher grain, renewable fuels, and fertilizer shipments.\nTITLE: BNSF\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal were $795 million in the third quarter and $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, declines of 14.7% and 25.2%, respectively, from 2023. The revenue declines were attributable to reduced volumes of 12.5% in the third quarter and 20.5% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023 and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decreases were primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices, which displaced coal as a fuel used by utilities.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $3.8 billion in the third quarter and $11.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024, decreases of $82 million (2.1%) and $180 million (1.5%), respectively, compared to 2023. Fuel expenses declined $64 million (7.4%) in the third quarter and $185 million (7.0%) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, which was primarily due to lower average fuel prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses decreased $20 million (4.0%) in the third quarter and $47 million (2.9%) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Expenses in the third quarter declined primarily due to cost reductions across various spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by higher casualty costs. Expenses in the first nine months of 2024 declined due to cost reductions across various spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by litigation costs related to the judgment in the ongoing legal case with the Swinomish Tribe, which BNSF has appealed. There were no significant changes in compensation and benefits, purchased services, or depreciation and amortization expense as increases from higher volumes and inflation were more than offset by lower costs and improved productivity.\n"

See Note 23 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Wildfires.\nTEXT: In addition, net earnings of U.S. utilities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflected comparative increases in other income, electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and income tax benefits from higher recognized wind production tax credits, partially offset by increases in other energy operating expenses and higher interest expense. Interest expense increased $81 million in the third quarter and $267 million in the first nine months of 2024 over 2023, largely due to increased borrowings, including $4.4 billion of subsidiary term debt issued in January 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%. The increases in other energy operating expenses were primarily due to higher vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $2.4 billion in the third quarter and $6.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024, increases of $50 million (2.1%) and $152 million (2.6%) compared to 2023. The increases reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs and lower wholesale volumes and rates. Retail customer volumes increased 3.6% overall (up 6.6% at NV Energy, 3.2% at PacifiCorp and 0.6% at MEC) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to increases in customer usage and in the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather.\nTEXT: Net earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $19 million in the third quarter and $196 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The increases in earnings reflected reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests due to the acquisition of an additional 50% ownership interest in the Cove Point facility on September 1, 2023, as well as higher transportation revenue and increased margin on gas sales.\nTEXT: Net earnings of other energy businesses increased $62 million in the third quarter and $151 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The increases reflected higher earnings at Northern Powergrid and the non-regulated retail services business, partially offset by lower earnings at the renewable energy business. The increases at Northern Powergrid were attributable to higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments and lower income tax expense attributable to charges recognized in 2023 for the U.K. Energy Profits Levy and a group relief tax benefit recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable results at the natural gas exploration business and higher other operating expenses. Earnings from the renewable energy business decreased mainly due to unfavorable pricing and generation at certain projects, lower earnings from wind tax equity investments in the first nine months of 2024 and debt extinguishment gains recognized in the second quarter of 2023.\nTEXT: Net earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $5 million in the third quarter and $121 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The decline for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily attributable to expense accruals in connection with the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters.

Pre-tax earnings increased $62 million (4.3%) in the third quarter and $322 million (7.3%) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the first nine months of 2024 increased 0.8 percentage points compared to the first nine months of 2023.\nTEXT: PCC’s revenues were $2.6 billion in the third quarter and $7.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024, increases of 11.9% and 12.4%, respectively, compared to 2023. The revenue increases were primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser degree, power generation products. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 25.1% in the third quarter and 23.4% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The earnings increases were primarily attributable to sales increases and generally improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Continued growth in revenues and earnings will be predicated on our ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products, as well as from improvements in industry supply chains and labor relations, which are currently constraining commercial aircraft production at original equipment manufacturers.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the third quarter of 2024, an increase of 2.8% over 2023, attributable to higher volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower selling prices. Revenues in the first nine months of 2024 were $4.9 billion, relatively unchanged compared to 2023, as higher volumes were essentially offset by lower selling prices and unfavorable product mix. Sales volumes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 each increased 5% compared to 2023, reflecting higher volumes in both the additives and advance materials businesses. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings increased 36.2% in the third quarter and 44.7% in the first nine months of 2024, primarily attributable to lower raw material costs, higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs, partially offset by the impact of lower selling prices and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $3.1 billion in the third quarter and $9.3 billion in the first nine months of 2024, relatively unchanged from the third quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 2.6% compared to the first nine months of 2023. The Transportation Products group experienced comparative revenue declines of nearly 20% due to reduced volumes, following very strong demand in 2023. The Metal Services and Retail Solutions groups also experienced lower revenues in each period due to reduced customer demand. Conversely, Electrical group revenues increased in each period due to higher copper prices and increased volumes. The Rail & Leasing group generated higher revenues in each period due to higher average lease renewal rates and increased railcar repair prices and volumes.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings declined 13.0% in the third quarter and 9.4% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023. The declines reflected lower earnings from the Transportation Products, Metals Services and Retail Solutions groups due to the revenue declines, as well as lower earnings from the Crane Services and Electrical groups and lower financial and other income. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings in the Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies and Foodservice Technologies groups, although the Rail & Leasing group earnings in the third quarter of 2024 were negatively impacted by higher railcar re-certification maintenance costs.\nTEXT: IMC’s revenues were approximately $1.0 billion in the third quarter and $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024, decreases of 1.4% and 1.3%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Revenues in the first nine months of 2024 reflected lower organic sales and unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by business acquisitions and higher interest income. The declines in organic sales were attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 13.0% in the third quarter and 8.2% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower gross sales margins and higher selling, general and administrative expenses. IMC operates globally and a large portion of its products are manufactured in Israel. IMC’s operations in Israel have not been significantly impacted to date by the conflicts in the region.\nTEXT: The building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financial services (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks and masonry products (Acme Brick Company), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercial construction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).\nTEXT: Revenues of the building products group increased $167 million (2.5%) in the third quarter and $450 million (2.3%) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023.

Revenues from home sales increased $446 million (6.9%) in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting higher new home unit sales of 11.8%, partially offset by changes in sales mix and lower average selling prices. Also, financial services revenues increased 15.2% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $26.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 14.2% since September 30, 2023. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.\nTEXT: Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings declined $86 million (15.6%) in the third quarter and $95 million (6.3%) in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower earnings from financial services in each period, as well as comparatively lower earnings from manufacturing in the first nine months. The earnings declines from financial services reflected increased losses from insurance claims, attributable to weather events, increased expected loan loss provisions and higher interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates. Interest expense on such borrowings increased $83 million (61.9%) in the third quarter and $107 million (27.1%) in the first nine months of 2024 versus 2023 as borrowings increased $5.4 billion in the third quarter to better match the increase in loan receivable balances in recent years. The corresponding interest income is included in the “Other” earnings section on page 47.

Earnings as a percentage of revenues in the first nine months of 2024 were 16.1%, essentially unchanged compared to 2023. Earnings in 2024 were negatively impacted by increased restructuring and legal costs and weaker housing markets, which were partially offset by higher average gross margin rates from lower raw material costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies in certain of the businesses.\nTEXT: The consumer products group includes recreational vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (Fruit of the Loom, Garan, Fechheimer, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports), high-performance batteries (Duracell) and a global toy company (Jazwares).

The increases were primarily attributable to higher revenues from Forest River, Jazwares and Brooks Sports, partially offset by lower revenues from Fruit of the Loom, Garan and Richline. Forest River revenues increased 6.5% in the first nine months of 2024, reflecting a 9.1% increase in unit sales, which included the impact of business acquisitions over the past year. Average selling prices for recreational vehicles declined in 2024 and increased for bus and commercial vehicles, primarily attributable to changes in product mix. Jazwares and Brooks Sports revenues increased 11.6% and 8.9%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2024 over 2023.\nTEXT: Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $93 million (19.3%) in the third quarter and $200 million (18.0%) in the first nine months of 2024 versus 2023. The increases were primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell and a 3.9% increase in year-to-date earnings from Forest River. Apparel and footwear earnings increased 41.0% in the first nine months of 2024 from 2023, primarily due to gross margin rate increases and increased gains on asset sales, as well as from the favorable effects of past restructuring and cost management efforts. The earnings increases from Duracell were attributable to reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and higher gross margins.\nTITLE: Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\nTEXT: A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months; 2024 2023 2024 2023; Service $ 5,130 $ 5,100 $ 15,492 $ 15,600; Retailing 4,712 4,846 14,000 14,418; McLane 12,723 13,477 37,656 39,419; $ 22,565 $ 23,423 $ 67,148 $ 69,437; Service $ 569 $ 772 $ 1,793 $ 2,433; Retailing 308 414 961 1,236; McLane 145 116 452 358; $ 1,022 $ 1,302 $ 3,206 $ 4,027; Service 11.1 % 15.1 % 11.6 % 15.6 %; Retailing 6.5 8.5 6.9 8.6; McLane 1.1 0.9 1.2 0.9.\nTITLE: Third Quarter First Nine Months\nTITLE: Third Quarter\nTITLE: First Nine Months\nTITLE: 2024 2023 2024 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Revenues\nTITLE: Pre-tax earnings\n"

TTI revenues declined 10.0% in the third quarter and 12.1% in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to lower sales volumes and pricing pressures. Sales at TTI in 2024 declined across most regions, markets and product lines, attributable to excess inventory levels within supply chains, which contributed to lower customer demand. These conditions are expected to continue over the remainder of 2024. Revenues from aviation services increased 10.4% in the third quarter and 9.8% in the first nine months of 2024 versus 2023.

Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders were $69.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024 and included after-tax investment gains of approximately $36.4 billion. Investment gains and losses from changes in the market prices of our investments in equity securities will produce significant volatility in our earnings.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. We are not committed to repurchase minimum or subject to maximum amounts. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $2.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024 to repurchase its common stock.\nTEXT: At September 30, 2024, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills, net of payables for unsettled purchases, of $305.5 billion. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities, excluding our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental common stock, were $287.7 billion. During the first nine months of 2024, we paid $5.8 billion to acquire equity securities and we received $133.2 billion from sales of equity securities.\nTEXT: On January 16, 2024, we acquired the remaining 20% noncontrolling ownership interest in Pilot for $2.6 billion. On September 30, 2024, BHE repurchased shares of its common stock and a $100 million debenture held by certain noncontrolling BHE shareholders in exchange for cash of $2.4 billion and a promissory note with a par amount of $600 million, which was repaid in October 2024.\nTEXT: Our consolidated borrowings at September 30, 2024 were $124.5 billion, of which over 95% were issued by the Berkshire parent company and BHFC, or by BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 was $19.6 billion, an increase of $857 million from December 31, 2023. In April 2024, Berkshire issued an aggregate ¥263.3 billion (approximately $1.7 billion) of senior notes. In September 2024, Berkshire issued ¥142.5 billion (approximately $1.0 billion) of 1.25% term debt due in 2028. In October 2024, Berkshire issued ¥281.8 billion (approximately $1.85 billion) of senior notes with interest rates ranging from 1.031% to 2.625% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054. In the first nine months of 2024, senior note maturities were $1.9 billion.\nTEXT: Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $18.2 billion at September 30, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest.\nTEXT: BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. In the first nine months of 2024, BNSF issued $1.3 billion of 5.5% debentures due in 2055 and repaid approximately $1.2 billion of maturing senior debentures. BHE’s aggregate borrowings increased $1.0 billion in the first nine months of 2024 to approximately $57.3 billion at September 30. In the first nine months of 2024, BHE subsidiaries issued $5.4 billion of term debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and maturity dates ranging from 2029 to 2055 and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt and short-term borrowings aggregating approximately $4.4 billion. In October 2024, a BHE subsidiary issued $900 million of 5.6% senior notes due in 2054. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.\nTEXT: In the first nine months of 2024, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $26.0 billion, which reflects income tax payments of $17.5 billion, including $15.3 billion paid in the third quarter. Income tax payments in 2024 included significant U.S. Federal estimated income tax payments derived from taxable gains on sales of equity securities. The gross proceeds from such sales were included in cash flows from investing activities.\nTEXT: Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $9.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2024 are approximately $3.7 billion.\n"

Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as borrowings, operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities.\nTEXT: We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Estimates” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 included estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $148.9 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $84.6 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.9 billion. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2023, the estimated fair values of nine reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. Our estimated aggregate fair value of these units at that time was approximately $58.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $54.9 billion. Goodwill of these reporting units totaled approximately $17.3 billion. Three of these reporting units were acquired in late 2022 and early 2023, and, in the aggregate, had an estimated fair value of $21.5 billion, or 1.5% greater than the carrying value, and goodwill of approximately $8.5 billion.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods may be used to estimate fair values and significant judgments are required in making such estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on changes in market and economic conditions and events affecting our businesses, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: Information concerning accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements.\nTEXT: Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, geopolitical conflict, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, and other events that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. No Class A or Class B shares were repurchased in the third quarter of 2024.\nTABLE: TABLE: Period Total number ofshares purchased Average pricepaid per share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publiclyannounced program Maximum number orvalue of shares that yetmay be repurchasedunder the program; Class A common stock — $ — — *; Class B common stock — $ — — *; Class A common stock — $ — — *; Class B common stock — $ — — *; Class A common stock — $ — — *; Class B common stock — $ — — *.\nTITLE: Period\nTITLE: Total number ofshares purchased\nTITLE: Average pricepaid per share\nTITLE: Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publiclyannounced program\nTITLE: Maximum number orvalue of shares that yetmay be repurchasedunder the program\nTEXT: * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.\n"
