We manage our operating businesses on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporate management team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note 25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.\nTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic affected our operating businesses in varying ways and degrees, particularly in 2020 and 2021. Significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. Further, geopolitical conflicts, including the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developed in 2022 and are continuing in 2023. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of these events on our businesses. Nor can we reliably predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns of consumers and businesses we serve.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting generated an after-tax loss of $90 million in 2022 and after-tax earnings of $728 million in 2021 and $657 million in 2020. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, $2.3 billion in 2021 and $750 million in 2020. Underwriting results in 2022 were also negatively impacted by increases in private passenger automobile claims frequencies and severities at GEICO, and favorably impacted by higher earnings from reinsurance underwriting and foreign currency exchange rate gains arising from the remeasurement of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries.\nTEXT: Underwriting results in 2021 were favorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities and by the reduction in earned premium from the GEICO Giveback program, as well as from high claims costs in the life reinsurance business. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from the GEICO Giveback program, significantly reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance coverages.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $1.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, attributable to increased dividend income and higher interest rates. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by low interest rates on our substantial holdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Results in 2022 reflected higher revenue per car/unit, substantially offset by lower overall freight volumes and higher fuel and other operating costs. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected relatively low railroad operating revenues from reduced shipping volumes, attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased 9.3% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 13.7% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in 2022 reflected higher earnings from other energy businesses, including tax equity investments and the Northern Powergrid businesses, as well as from the natural gas pipeline businesses, partly offset by lower earnings from the real estate brokerage business. The increase in 2021 reflected higher earnings from the U.S. utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses.\nTEXT: Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 12.5% in 2022 compared to 2021 and 34.0% in 2021 versus 2020. Operating results in 2022 were mixed among our various businesses. While customer demand for products and services was relatively good in 2022, demand began to weaken in the second half of the year at certain of our businesses. We experienced the negative effects of higher materials, freight, labor and other input costs through much of 2022. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020, attributable to relatively strong customer demand for products and higher selling prices, partially offset by higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains.\nTEXT: Investment and derivative contract gains (losses) in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains and losses from market price changes. We believe that investment gains and losses on investments in equity securities, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.\nTEXT: Other earnings included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of approximately $1.3 billion in 2022 and $1.0 billion in 2021 and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). Other earnings also included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $157 million in 2022, $259 million in 2021 and $11.0 billion in 2020. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016.\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: Our management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.\nTEXT: The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. We currently consider pre-tax incurred losses exceeding $150 million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. Significant catastrophe events in 2022 included Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia, while significant events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida, floods in Europe and Winter Storm Uri.\nTEXT: Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $143 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). On October 19, 2022, Berkshire acquired Alleghany Corporation (“Alleghany”), which operates property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses.

Time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing prices for these contracts. We normally receive all premiums at the contract inception date, which are immediately available for investment.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from the GEICO Giveback program, which provided a 15% premium reduction to all new or renewing voluntary auto and motorcycle policies between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claims frequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting losses in 2022 reflected significant increases in average claims severities, primarily due to significant cost inflation in property and physical damage claims, which began to accelerate in the second half of 2021 and have continued through 2022. Increases in used car prices are producing increased claims severities on total losses and shortages of car parts are contributing to elevated claims severities on partial losses. In addition, injury claims severities continued to trend higher in 2022.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Voluntary auto policies-in-force declined 8.9% in 2022 compared to 2021 while average premiums per voluntary auto policy increased 11.3%. Premiums earned increased $1.3 billion (3.4%) in 2022 compared to 2021, partially attributable to a reduction in 2021 of approximately $475 million from the remaining impact of the GEICO Giveback program.\nTEXT: Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.3 billion (17.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021. GEICO’s ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) was 93.1% in 2022, an increase of 10.9 percentage points over 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to higher claims frequencies and severities, as well as lower reductions of ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ events.\nTEXT: Claims frequencies in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (one to two percent range), bodily injury and collision (four to five percent range) and personal injury (three to four percent range). Average claims severities in 2022 were higher for all coverages, including property damage (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range), collision (fourteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury (nine to eleven percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses reflected reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior years’ loss events of $653 million in 2022 compared to $1.8 billion in 2021. The reductions in 2022 reflected decreases in all major coverages except collision and property damage coverages, while the reductions in 2021 were across all major coverages. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately $400 million from Hurricane Ian in 2022 and $375 million from Hurricane Ida in 2021.\nTEXT: Underwriting expenses decreased $881 million (16.2%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant reductions in advertising costs and lower employee-related costs. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 11.7% in 2022, a decrease of 2.8 percentage points compared to 2021, attributable to both the decrease in expenses as well as the increase in earned premiums.\nTEXT: GEICO has successfully obtained premium rate increase approvals from certain states in response to the significant claims costs increases it has experienced in recent years. As a result, we currently expect GEICO to generate an underwriting profit in 2023.\nTEXT: Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction of approximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program.

GEICO’s loss ratio increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significant catastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years.\nTEXT: Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen to fourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percent range).

The decrease in 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation effects ($289 million) and decreased volume in the Asia Pacific region. Premiums written in 2020 included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that did not renew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in the Asia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Life and health benefits declined $929 million (18.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to relatively high pandemic-related mortality claims in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America in 2021. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased life benefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in assumptions used in estimating disability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S. long-term care business in run-off.\nTEXT: Retroactive reinsurance underwriting results primarily derive from the runoff of contracts written several years ago. Pre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in the estimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gains and losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax foreign currency gains were $168 million in 2022 and $58 million in 2021 versus pre-tax losses of $171 million in 2020.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $836 million in 2022, $840 million in 2021 and $1.1 billion in 2020, primarily from deferred charge amortization. Underwriting results also reflected the effects of changes in the estimates of the timing of future payments and amounts of ultimate claim liabilities. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for prior years’ contracts were increased $86 million in 2022 and reduced $974 million in 2021, which net of related changes in unamortized deferred charges, produced relatively insignificant effects on underwriting earnings.\nTEXT: Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $35.4 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $2.4 billion since December 31, 2021, primarily attributable to paid claims. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022, a decline of $769 million since December 31, 2021. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.\nTEXT: Periodic payment annuity premiums earned decreased $76 million (11.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, which increased $92 million (16.3%) compared to 2020. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. Our volumes written may change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)\nTEXT: Our periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses from the recurring accretion of time-value discounted annuity liabilities, which includes discount accruals on liabilities of contracts without life contingencies. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $164 million in 2022 and $18 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $67 million in 2020.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency exchange effects were $696 million in 2022, $526 million in 2021 and $550 million in 2020. Pre-tax losses in 2022 included approximately $130 million attributable to the termination of a reinsurance contract, in which the settlement paid exceeded the carrying value of the liabilities. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted liabilities were $15.4 billion at December 31, 2022, which included $3.9 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%. Upon the adoption of ASU 2018-12 in 2023, the discount rates on contracts with life-contingent liabilities will be adjusted quarterly based upon prevailing interest rates which could have a significant effect on our recorded liabilities. The periodic effect from discount rate changes will be reflected in other comprehensive income.\nTEXT: Variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax gains of $117 million in 2022 and $114 million in 2021, and pre-tax losses of $18 million in 2020. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. Underwriting earnings in 2022 and 2021 were primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate increases and changes in securities markets.\n"

The increase in 2022 reflected an overall increase in equity security investments during 2022. Dividend income also varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.

Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment.\nTEXT: Interest and other investment income increased $1.1 billion (186.1%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to significant increases in interest income due to interest rate increases during the year, as well as the inclusion of interest income on assets of Alleghany’s insurance subsidiaries. Interest and other investment income in 2021 declined 44.4% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities.

Float approximated $164 billion at December 31, 2022, $147 billion at December 31, 2021 and $138 billion at December 31, 2020. Float at December 31, 2022 included approximately $14 billion attributable to Alleghany’s insurance and reinsurance businesses. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting losses of $98 million in 2022, and the cost of float was nominal.

Our ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 5.0 percentage points to 65.9% in 2022 versus 2021. The operating expense increase was primarily attributable to significant increases in the cost of fuel, as well as higher compensation and benefits expense. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $557 million (11.9%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to wage inflation, including the impact from the ratified union labor agreements, higher health and welfare costs and lower productivity. Fuel expenses increased $1.8 billion (65.6%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher average fuel prices, partially offset by lower volumes. Equipment rents, materials and other expenses increased $384 million (21.8%) in 2022 compared to 2021, due to general inflation, lower gains from land and easement sales and higher casualty and litigation costs.\nTEXT: Approximately 31,000 of BNSF’s employees are members of a labor union. The U.S. Class I railroads and rail labor unions were engaged in multi-party national negotiations from January 2020 through June 2022. Federal mediation was included in that timeframe, followed by a release from the National Mediation Board and subsequent appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board (PEB), in accordance with the Railway Labor Act. The PEB issued its report and recommendations to settle the bargaining disputes on August 16, 2022. Tentative agreements based on these recommendations were reached with all labor unions in September 2022. Thereafter, a majority of the unions ratified those agreements with the remainder being imposed by Congress in December 2022. This concluded the national round which is not subject to re-opening until late 2024.\nTEXT: Railroad operating revenues increased 11.6% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting higher volumes of 6.9%, as well as a 3.5% increase in average revenue per car/unit resulting from business mix changes and higher fuel surcharge revenue attributable to higher fuel prices. Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021 were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by disruptions in the global supply chain.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflecting increased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth in intermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and increased e-commerce activity. Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumes increased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily due to improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partially offset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenue change reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol and related commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit. Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumes of 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increased electricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus 2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset by the favorable impact of productivity improvements. Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expenses increased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices.

After-tax earnings increased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The earnings increase reflected higher electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and a $157 million increase in production tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service at PacifiCorp and MEC, partially offset by higher operating expenses and state income taxes. Operating expenses increased due to higher costs associated with certain regulatory mechanisms at MEC and NV Energy, increases in general and plant maintenance costs, incremental depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service and higher accruals at PacifiCorp associated with the 2020 wildfires.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $7.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $586 million (8.3%) compared to 2021. The increase reflected higher operating revenue from favorable retail and wholesale pricing and increases in retail customer volumes, partially offset by increases in thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 2.4% (1.6% at PacifiCorp, 4.3% at MEC and 2.2% at NV Energy) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nTEXT: Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $233 million in 2022 compared to 2021. Substantially all of the increase was derived from BHE GT&S, primarily attributable to higher regulated storage and service revenues from a general rate case settlement and higher revenues and margins from non-regulated activities, as well as income tax adjustments.\nTEXT: Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $359 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to increased wind tax equity investment earnings of $200 million and the impact in 2021 on income tax expense of $109 million at Northern Powergrid related to the enactment in June 2021 of an increase in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The earnings increase also reflected higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and earnings from new gas exploration and solar projects, partially offset by lower earnings from natural gas generating facilities and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects in 2022. The increase in wind tax equity investment earnings reflected the impact of losses in 2021 on pre-existing tax equity investments due to the February 2021 winter storms as well as increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.\nTEXT: Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings decreased $287 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease reflected lower brokerage services revenues and margins, primarily due to an 11% reduction in closed brokerage transaction volumes, as well as lower mortgage services revenues and margins from a 40% decrease in closed transaction volumes, attributable to lower homeowner refinancing activity resulting from rising interest rates.\nTEXT: Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $84 million in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower state income tax benefits and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2022.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

The earnings increase in 2021 was primarily due to incremental earnings of $211 million from the BHE GT&S acquisition completed in November 2020. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and higher transportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year.\nTEXT: Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings increased $26 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid ($46 million), partially offset by lower earnings from renewable energy. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher tariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs and favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $74 million from increases in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rates in both 2021 and 2020. The decline in earnings from renewable energy reflected a reduction in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing tax equity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increased income tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months.\nTEXT: Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020.

The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestock and agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer and LiquidPower Specialty Products). Beginning October 19, 2022, this group includes the structural steel fabrication products business conducted through W&W|AFCO Steel, acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition Additionally, the Alleghany businesses included certain other smaller manufacturers that primarily became part of Marmon.\nTEXT: Revenues of the industrial products group in 2022 increased $2.6 billion (9.4%) and pre-tax earnings increased $393 million (8.8%) compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2022 was 15.8%, a decrease of 0.1 percentage points compared 2021.\nTEXT: PCC’s revenues were $7.5 billion in 2022, an increase of $1.1 billion (16.5%) compared to 2021. PCC derives significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The revenue increase in 2022 was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products. Commercial aircraft delivery rates by original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) of narrow-body aircraft have rebounded since the onset of the pandemic. Deliveries of wide-body aircraft remain relatively low, in part, attributable to the pause in the Boeing 787 program. However, Boeing resumed deliveries in the third quarter of 2022. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and strong demand for air travel and aerospace products.\nTEXT: PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 1.6% compared to 2021. PCC’s results in 2022 were negatively affected by increased costs for labor and training, materials and utilities and supply chain disruptions, as well as a $59 million reduction in pension plan income. PCC management has taken and will continue to take actions to improve operations, maintain safety and prepare for increased demand for its products. Growth in PCC’s revenues and earnings will be predicated on the ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace demand, including managing through the current supply chain and employment environments.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.7 billion in 2022, an increase of 3.2% compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected higher average selling prices, partially offset by lower volumes and adverse foreign currency translation effects from the stronger U.S. Dollar. Sales volumes throughout 2022 were restricted by effects of supply constraints for certain raw materials and the effects of unplanned plant maintenance activities, both of which limited Lubrizol’s production capabilities. The increase in average selling prices was driven by escalating prices for raw materials, including oil feedstocks, as well as for utilities, packaging, shipping and freight costs. We believe supply chain and required maintenance constraints are easing and that we can increase production rates and sales volumes in 2023.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2022 increased 48.6% compared to 2021. Pre-tax earnings in 2022 included insurance recoveries of $242 million related to a fire in 2019 at the Rouen, France facility and a fire in 2021 at the Rockton, Illinois, facility compared to insurance recoveries of $55 million in 2021. Earnings in 2022 also included aggregate losses related to the Rockton, Illinois fire of $36 million compared to aggregate losses and asset impairment charges in 2021 of $257 million related to the Rockton facility fire and an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials product lines. Earnings in 2022 were also negatively impacted by rising raw material costs, lower sales volumes, higher unplanned maintenance expenses, and by unfavorable foreign currency translation effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Earnings in 2021 were negatively impacted by severe winter storms, which caused industry-wide temporary facilities closures, including at our Additives facilities, which experienced lost sales and incremental manufacturing and other operating costs.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $10.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $934 million (9.6%) compared to 2021. Nearly all of Marmon’s business groups generated higher revenues in 2022, led by significant increases in the Transportation, Retail Solutions, Metal Services and Crane groups, which contributed 82% of the increase. These increases generally reflected higher volumes and prices in our heavy-duty truck & trailer, shopping cart and store shelving businesses, stronger demand in Canada for metal services and higher demand in the mining and infrastructure markets. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the transit, oil & gas, utility and restaurant markets, also increased in 2022, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates and fewer third-party tank car sales.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Earnings in 2022 reflected increases in the Transportation, Metal Services, Retail, Crane and several other business groups due to higher volumes and pricing, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting lower renewal rates, higher repair costs and losses of approximately $90 million related to the shutdown in the second quarter of its business in Russia.\nTEXT: IMC’s revenues increased 4.5% to $3.7 billion in 2022 compared to 2021, reflecting increased sales in most regions, partially offset by the foreign currency translation effects of a stronger U.S. Dollar, lower sales in China (attributable to the pandemic) and the effects the Russia-Ukraine conflict in Europe. IMC’s pre-tax earnings decreased 2.5% in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily due to lower average gross sales margins, primarily attributable to changes in product sales mix and higher raw material costs.

The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and OEM aircraft production in 2021 and 2020. PCC’s revenues were negatively impacted in both years by reduced aircraft production levels, which reflected order delays and cancellations by airlines and inventory reduction initiatives within the industry.\nTEXT: PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020, which reflected significant restructuring costs and inefficiencies associated with reduction in production. Asset impairment and restructuring costs in 2020 were $295 million. The 2021 earnings increase also reflected the actions taken by management in 2020 and 2021 to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higher average selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly higher volumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines in 2021 were negatively affected by the impacts of the severe winter weather events in the first quarter, raw materials supply constraints and unplanned maintenance in the second half of the year.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. The earnings decline in 2021 included previously mentioned losses of $257 million related to the Rockton, Illinois facility fire and asset impairment charges, as well as the adverse effects of rising raw material costs and the winter storms in 2021.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020, which was negatively impacted by the initial effects of the pandemic. Revenues in 2021 from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over half of the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, including the impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularly those serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting higher volumes. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestitures and business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasing group, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 16.6% in 2022 and 13.6% in 2021. During 2021 and much of 2022, our businesses experienced relatively strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. Our building products businesses benefited in recent years from the low interest rate environment. However, interest rates in the U.S. increased significantly during 2022, which contributed to slowing demand for new home construction in the fourth quarter. As such, comparative revenues and earnings in the near term will likely decline from current levels.\nTEXT: Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $12.7 billion in 2022, an increase of $2.2 billion (21.1%) over 2021. Revenues from home sales for the year increased $2.1 billion (25.1%) in 2022 to approximately $10.4 billion, primarily due to higher average selling prices. New home unit sales increased 6.2% in 2022, reflecting a 6.0% increase in factory-built manufactured home unit sales and a 7.1% increase in site-built home unit sales. However, unit sales in the fourth quarter of 2022 declined 3.9% from 2021, and our net order backlog declined significantly during 2022. We expect the comparative decline in unit sales to accelerate in the near term. Financial services revenues, which include mortgage, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 4.7% in 2022 compared to 2021. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $21.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, an increase of approximately $2.5 billion from December 31, 2021. Actual and anticipated loan foreclosures rose during the fourth quarter of 2022.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of $685 million (40.7%) compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 reflected higher home sales, gross margin rates and net interest income. As previously mentioned, we expect unit home sales to decline in the near term and we anticipate earnings will also decline in 2023 compared to 2022.\nTEXT: Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $16.2 billion in 2022, an increase of 11.8% versus 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices, and to a lesser extent, from higher unit volumes in certain product lines and product mix changes. Significant cost inflation in 2021, that continued through 2022, largely drove the higher selling prices.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $2.4 billion in 2022, an increase of 41.9% over 2021. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 15.0% in 2022, a 3.2 percentage point increase compared to 2021. Earnings in 2022 benefitted from higher selling prices and strong demand in certain product categories, as well as an increase in gains from certain business divestitures and asset sales and reduced impairment and restructuring charges. The increase in earnings in 2022 also reflected the negative impact of severe winter storms in the first quarter of 2021, which reduced sales and increased production and other operating costs in 2021.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020. During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced various forms of supply chain disruptions that contributed to considerable raw material and logistics cost inflation and supply constraints.\nTEXT: Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020. Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenue per home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in 2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longer construction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues increased 7.8% in 2021 compared to 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%) compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest income and lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs. The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTEXT: Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input and supply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineered products.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7% over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues were 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to 2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs from supply chain disruptions negatively affected operating results. In addition, higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.\nTEXT: The consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations (including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performance alkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl), jewelry products (Richline) and beginning October 19, 2022, Jazwares, LLC (“Jazwares”), a global toy company acquired in connection with the Alleghany acquisition.\nTEXT: Consumer products group revenues increased $481 million (3.1%) in 2022 versus 2021, reflecting an 8.0% increase from Forest River and the impact of the Jazwares acquisition, substantially offset by lower apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues (4.7% in the aggregate). In the fourth quarter of 2022, consumer products revenues before the impact of the Jazwares acquisition declined 15.7%, driven by significant declines in recreational vehicle unit sales. Revenues of Forest River increased 8.0% in 2022 compared to 2021, while apparel and footwear and Duracell revenues decreased 4.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The declines in apparel and footwear revenues were driven by lower volumes, as major retailers reduced orders in response to rising inventories. Duracell’s revenue decline was primarily due to lower volumes and unfavorable foreign currency translation effects of the stronger U.S. Dollar.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

The earnings decline reflected lower aggregate earnings from the apparel and footwear businesses (68.0%) and Duracell (30.6%), partially offset by higher earnings from Forest River (7.6%).\nTEXT: Our apparel businesses were negatively affected in 2022 by low sales volumes, reduced manufacturing efficiencies and higher input costs, including raw materials, freight, labor and other operating costs. The reductions in sales volumes and supply chain issues in 2021 and 2022 have also elevated our current inventories. We currently believe retailers will continue to constrain purchases in the near term and that our sales volumes and earnings will continue to be negatively affected. We are taking measures to right-size our operations for the long-term and reduce product inventories to more appropriate levels. Duracell’s earnings in 2022 declined, primarily due to lower sales, cost inflation and foreign currency translation effects.\nTEXT: Earnings from Forest River increased in 2022, primarily due to the increase in unit sales in the first half of the year and higher average selling prices, partly offset by higher materials costs. However, sales volumes, revenues and earnings declined over the second half of the year compared to the elevated levels in the first half of 2022 and in 2021. We currently expect demand for recreational vehicles will continue to slow and Forest River’s comparative revenues and earnings to decline in 2023, particularly over the first half of the year.\nTEXT: Consumer products group revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest River increased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher average selling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs.\nTEXT: Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had a severe impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and from increased consumer demand.

Our other service businesses franchise and service a network of quick service restaurants (Dairy Queen), lease transportation equipment (XTRA) and furniture (CORT), provide third party logistics services that primarily serve the petroleum and chemical industries (Charter Brokerage), distribute electronic news, multimedia and regulatory filings (Business Wire) and operate a television station in Miami, Florida (WPLG). Beginning, October 19, 2022, this group includes IPS Integrated Project Services, LLC (IPS), a provider of various services in facilities construction management.\nTEXT: Service group revenues increased $3.1 billion (19.7%) in 2022 compared to 2021, primarily attributable to revenue increases from TTI and the aviation services businesses, as well as the impact of the IPS acquisition. Revenues from TTI increased 17.4% in 2022 versus 2021. However, in the third quarter, new orders began to slow in certain regions and markets and the slowing of new orders was observed across nearly all regions in the fourth quarter. The slowing of electronic components demand is in part attributable to elevated inventory levels within the supply chain. Revenues from aviation services increased 18.2% in 2022 compared to 2021. The revenue increase reflected year-to-date increases in training hours (11%), customer flight hours (9%), most of which occurred in the first half of the year, and fuel surcharges to customers due to the increase in customer flight hours and significant increases in fuel prices. These increases were partially offset by changes in sales mix.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $375 million (14.0%) in 2022 to $3.0 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 16.0% in 2022, a decrease of 0.8 percentage points compared to 2021. The earnings increase in 2022 was attributable to TTI (19.4%) and aviation services (3.4%), as well as increased earnings from several of our smaller services businesses. The increase from TTI was primarily attributable to the increase in sales and higher average gross margin rates, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2022 and a favorable legal settlement in 2021. The earnings increase from aviation services in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to improved product sales margins, increased training hours and lower restructuring costs at FlightSafety. Earnings at our smaller services companies increased $106 million (19.3%) over 2021, reflecting a combination of higher revenues and operating cost leverage.\nTEXT: Service group revenues increased $3.5 billion (28.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily attributable to higher revenues from TTI and the aviation services businesses. Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarily attributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent, higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted to maintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chain disruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher training hours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues was 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings at nearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation services businesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to increases in sales volumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage, changes in sales mix and a gain from a legal settlement. The increase in earnings from aviation services was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies, lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable to the significant increase in flight demand.\nTEXT: Our largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc.

The decrease reflected significant increases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales and slightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 by upstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higher inventory costs, and disruptions in inventory availability. These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we experienced, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, hiring and wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021.

The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program is expected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion.

On October 19, 2022, we acquired Alleghany Corporation for $11.5 billion, which held cash and investments of $19.7 billion as of the acquisition date. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot for approximately $8.2 billion, which was based on Pilot’s unaudited earnings in 2022 and its net debt as of December 31, 2022 and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of the audit of Pilot’s 2022 consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2022 were $122.7 billion, of which approximately 94% were by the Berkshire parent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. During 2022, Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries issued term debt of approximately $12.7 billion in the aggregate and paid approximately $3.9 billion of maturing senior debt. Expected principal and interest payments related to our consolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $17.4 in 2023; $10.4 in 2024; $11.0 in 2025; $8.7 in 2026; and $8.1 in 2027.\nTEXT: Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2022 was $21.4 billion, substantially unchanged from December 31, 2021. In 2022, Berkshire issued an aggregate ¥243.5 billion (approximately $1.94 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.8%. Berkshire’s borrowings decreased $1.4 billion during 2022 from changes in foreign currency exchange rates on its non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $25.1 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $7.3 billion since December 31, 2021. Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2022, an increase of $4.8 billion since December 31, 2021, reflecting the issuance of debt, repayments of maturing debt ($775 million) and reductions in the carrying value of non-U.S. denominated debt due to foreign currency exchange rate changes ($300 million). In 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes maturing in 2027, 2032 and 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest. Subsidiary borrowings as of December 31, 2022 included approximately $2.3 billion attributable to Alleghany and its subsidiaries.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $15.5 billion in 2022, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $11.0 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these two operations will approximate $13.7 billion in 2023.\nTEXT: On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“the 2022 act”) was signed into law. The 2022 act contains numerous provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum income tax on “adjusted financial statement income”, expanded tax credits for clean energy incentives and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. The provisions of the 2022 act become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. On December 27, 2022, the IRS and Department of Treasury issued initial guidance for taxpayers subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax. The guidance addresses several, but not all, issues that needed clarification. The IRS and Department of Treasury intend to release additional guidance in the future. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the Act as more guidance becomes available. We currently do not expect a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTITLE: Contractual Obligations\nTEXT: We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next five years are (in billions): $1.8 in 2023; $1.6 in 2024; $1.4 in 2025; $1.3 in 2026; and $1.5 in 2027.\nTEXT: We are also obligated to pay claims arising from our property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $143 billion at December 31, 2022. We currently forecast claim payments in 2023 of approximately $35 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2023. Additionally, we estimate net payments of approximately $2 billion in 2023 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2022, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and certain raw materials purchase commitments. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately $24 billion, including $12 billion in 2023.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Policies\nTEXT: Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances.

The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions.\nTEXT: As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.\nTEXT: Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2022 were approximately $143 billion, of which 78% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.\nTEXT: GEICO predominantly writes private passenger automobile insurance. As of December 31, 2022, GEICO’s gross unpaid losses were $24.8 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $23.8 billion. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize a combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.\nTEXT: Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2022, case development liabilities averaged approximately 38% of the case reserves. We select case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.\nTEXT: IBNR claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-age projections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the number of unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claim counts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.\nTEXT: We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.\nTEXT: Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2021 were reduced by $653 million during 2022, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2022 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.\nTEXT: With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2022. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $245 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nTITLE: Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses (Continued)\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\nTEXT: BHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issued through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups.

Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.\nTEXT: In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms. Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policies.\nTEXT: The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excess contracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates.\nTEXT: Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. In the U.S., client reporting is generally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of the U.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days after the end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage and other reasons.\nTEXT: As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain certain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business, thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiation with the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nTEXT: Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reported case losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2022, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $650 million for certain legacy workers’ compensation claims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\nTEXT: Paid and incurred loss development methods – These methods consider expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.\nTEXT: Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – These methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.\nTEXT: Frequency and severity methods – These methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims and the anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.\nTEXT: Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain catastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.\nTEXT: In 2022, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reduced estimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $114 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.1 billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible for these assumptions to increase at these rates.\nTEXT: For other casualty losses, other than asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $650 million in 2022. For certain significant casualty and general liability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $980 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $980 million are possible given the diversification in worldwide business.\nTEXT: The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excluding amounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2022. Net liabilities for such claims were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, new claims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

Claim liabilities associated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect the claim-tails to be very long. At December 31, 2022, gross unpaid losses were $35.4 billion and deferred charges were $9.9 billion.\nTEXT: Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect that maximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $52 billion. Absent significant judicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe it unlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimated gross liability.\nTEXT: We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishing our liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses under various scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. We then monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available information concerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed.\nTEXT: Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.\nTEXT: We increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $86 million in 2022. In 2022, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $2.4 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.\nTEXT: In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2022, we estimate that amortization expense in 2023 will approximate $860 million.\nTITLE: Other Critical Accounting Policies\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2022 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $78.1 billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.3 billion.

The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\n"

The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected by assumptions on the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the reporting units businesses, as well as other assumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting units, which we cannot reliably predict. Consequently, any fair value estimates can be subject to wide variations.\nTEXT: We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The key assumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.\nTEXT: In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2022, the estimated fair values of six reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting units was Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). Our estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $31.5 billion, exceeding our carrying value of approximately $30.3 billion by 4.0%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion. For the five other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $4.5 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $4.1 billion by 9.9%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $1.4 billion.\nTEXT: In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, and most significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10 billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC. Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of these amounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered several factors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand, employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production and the actions we were taking to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailing circumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewing for impairments.\nTITLE: Market Risk Disclosures\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject to market risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility. The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.\nTITLE: Equity Price Risk\nTEXT: Equity securities represent the most significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive to invest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningful amount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31, 2022, approximately 75% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in five companies.\nTEXT: We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide a margin of safety against short-term price volatility.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nTITLE: Equity Price Risk (Continued)\nTEXT: For the past several years, we were also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts.

Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)\nTITLE: Interest Rate Risk (Continued)\nTEXT: The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the best or worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nTITLE: Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nTEXT: The Precision Castparts Corp.

      "content": "ITEM 8:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\ncontracts, other, assets, value, losses, liabilities, income, when, financial, reinsurance\n\nTEXT: (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (a)Nature of operations and basis of consolidation Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe that reporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of their long-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain immaterial balances in the Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified in prior years to conform to current year presentations.(b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with the amortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. To varying degrees the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences continues to affect our operating businesses. Significant government and private sector actions have been taken since 2020 to control the spread and mitigate the economic effects of the virus and its variants. Such actions in 2022 included temporary business closures or restrictions of business activities in various parts of the world. In addition, significant disruptions of supply chains and higher costs emerged in 2021 and persisted in 2022. The development of geopolitical conflicts in 2022 contributed to disruptions of supply chains, resulting in cost increases for commodities, goods and services in many parts of the world. In the U.S. and elsewhere, governments are implementing actions intended to slow price inflation. The economic effects from these events over longer terms cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly, significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, including those associated with evaluations of certain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owed to us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts, may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods.(c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have maturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase. (d)Investments in fixed maturity securities We classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date. Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Substantially all of our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. K-75 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(d)Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued) We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities are sold, determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e)Investments in equity securities We carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses. (f)Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by GAAP. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional equity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value. (g)Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortized as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.K-76 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(g)Loans and finance receivables (Continued)Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. (h)Other receivables Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivables against the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. (i)Derivatives We carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j)Fair value measurements As defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange. (k)Inventories Inventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale. Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2022, we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 30% of consolidated inventories with the remainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFO was approximately $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. K-77 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(l)Property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease We use property, plant and equipment in our operations. We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions to property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease at cost, which includes asset additions, improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m)Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.(n)Goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets of that business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value, including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to, discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess up to the balance of goodwill is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. K-78 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(n)Goodwill and other intangible assets (Continued)Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required in estimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. (o)Revenue recognition We earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the loss exposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned in proportion to the coverage provided, which in most cases is ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(o)Revenue recognition (Continued)Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution. Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases. (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable under ceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize the deferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimated timing or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in such estimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, are included in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. (r)Insurance policy acquisition costs We capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize deferred policy acquisition costs to underwriting expenses as the related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized over the expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits. The recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs generally considers anticipated investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, related to property and casualty insurance contracts. K-80 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(s)Life, annuity and health insurance benefits Liabilities for future life, annuity and health insurance benefits represent the present value of expected future benefits and non-acquisition variable expenses, less the present value of expected future net premiums (the portion of gross premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses). In estimating future cash flows, we consider the timing and amounts of future claims, premiums and expenses, which require estimates concerning future investment yields, expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk. The interest rate assumptions used for discounting may vary by contract or underlying currency denomination of our reinsurance contracts. Generally, assumptions regarding cash flow and discount rate are fixed at the inception of the contract and changed only under certain adverse circumstances. The effects of changes in estimated cash flows and discount rate assumptions on benefit liabilities are recorded in earnings in the period of the change. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts under GAAP. We discount annuity liabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilities equals the premiums received less brokerage expense at the inception date. Discount rates for most contracts range between 3% to 7%. (t)Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u)Foreign currency The accounts of our non-U.S.-based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arising from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, including gains and losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included in earnings. (v)Income taxes Berkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes eligible subsidiaries. In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions. Provisions for current income tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred income tax assets when realization is not likely.Liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a component of income tax expense.K-81 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January 1, 2020, which provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried at amortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses therefore include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a charge to retained earnings of $388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses. (x)New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2022 In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requires reassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reporting period in valuing policyholder liabilities of long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts. Discount rate assumptions are established based upon upper-medium grade corporate bond yields that reflect the duration characteristics of the liabilities. ASU 2018-12 also provides for new disclosures. Under ASU 2018-12, the effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects from changes in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Prior to ASU 2018-12, the cash flow and discount rate assumptions were set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under certain adverse circumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements.We adopted ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method. Revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions were applied to contracts in-force between January 1, 2021 (the transition date) and December 31, 2022 with liabilities remeasured, with the cumulative effect from discount rate changes (based on prevailing interest rates) recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes in retained earnings.The adoption of ASU 2018-12 produced a cumulative after-tax reduction in our originally reported consolidated shareholders’ equity at the end of 2020 of approximately $6.4 billion (or 1.4%), consisting of reductions to accumulated other comprehensive income of $5.7 billion and retained earnings of $700 million. The cumulative decline in shareholders’ equity decreased to approximately $4.6 billion (or 0.9% of the shareholders’ equity originally reported) at December 31, 2021. The cumulative effect of adopting ASU 2018-12 will increase our shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2022 by approximately $1.0 billion. These effects reflect the after-tax increases or decreases to our life, health and annuity benefits liabilities and reinsurance recoverables, primarily derived from changes in discount rate assumptions. The effects of adopting ASU 2018-12 will be reflected primarily in other comprehensive income and the impact on our consolidated net earnings for each of the years ending December 31, 2022 and 2021 is not material.\n"

Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history, with adjustments to reflect current or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate from historical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information.

With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect to constructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years.

We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years.

We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value.

Premiums are generally earned in proportion to the coverage provided, which in most cases is ratably over the term of the contract with unearned premiums computed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts are generally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by the policies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts are earned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are received in full at the inception of the contracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts with experience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts. Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our sales contracts provide customers with these products directly or through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for consideration specified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices. Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone selling prices of each product or service. Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, late delivery penalties, volume discounts and other incentives, some of which may be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excise taxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities. Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenue includes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control of the goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer as sales revenue. Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of the arrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily from certain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transfers continuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and the contract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach of contract. The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freight from a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. K-79 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(o)Revenue recognition (Continued)Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewable energy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution.

Such anticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits. The recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs generally considers anticipated investment income. The unamortized balances are included in other assets and were approximately $3.8 billion and $3.4 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, related to property and casualty insurance contracts.\nTEXT: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(s)Life, annuity and health insurance benefits Liabilities for future life, annuity and health insurance benefits represent the present value of expected future benefits and non-acquisition variable expenses, less the present value of expected future net premiums (the portion of gross premium required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses).

These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adverse deviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk.

A reconciliation of the changes in claim liabilities, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follows (in millions). The changes in claim liabilities in 2022 within this table include Alleghany’s property and casualty claim liabilities beginning as of the October 19, 2022 acquisition date. 2022 2021 2020 Balances at beginning of year: Gross liabilities $ 86,664 $ 79,854 $ 73,019 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses (2,960 ) (2,912 ) (2,855 ) Net liabilities 83,704 76,942 70,164 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year 59,463 52,099 43,400 Prior accident years (2,672 ) (3,116 ) (356 ) Total 56,791 48,983 43,044 Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses: Current accident year (27,236 ) (22,897 ) (17,884 ) Prior accident years (23,083 ) (18,904 ) (18,862 ) Total (50,319 ) (41,801 ) (36,746 ) Foreign currency effect (508 ) (420 ) 480 Net liabilities of acquired businesses (see Note 2) 12,779 — — Balances at December 31: Net liabilities 102,447 83,704 76,942 Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses 5,025 2,960 2,912 Gross liabilities $ 107,472 $ 86,664 $ 79,854 Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shown in the preceding table were recorded in earnings and related to insured events occurring in the current year (“current accident year”) and events occurring in all prior years (“prior accident years”). Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident year incurred losses from significant catastrophe events (losses in excess of $150 million per event) were approximately $3.1 billion in 2022 ($2.5 billion from Hurricane Ian), $2.9 billion in 2021 and $950 million in 2020. Significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida ($1.5 billion), Winter Storm Uri and floods in Europe, while significant catastrophe events in 2020 included losses from Hurricanes Laura and Sally (about $600 million in the aggregate) and U.S. wildfires. Current accident year incurred losses for private passenger auto insurance increased significantly in 2022 and 2021, attributable to increases in claims frequencies and severities. K-92 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $2.7 billion in 2022, $3.1 billion in 2021 and $356 million in 2020, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 3.2% in 2022, 4.0% in 2021 and 0.5% in 2020. We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of primary insurance businesses by $1.1 billion in 2022, $2.4 billion in 2021 and $518 million in 2020. The reductions in each year derived primarily from private passenger auto, medical professional liability and workers’ compensation claims, partly offset by increases with respect to other casualty claims. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of property and casualty reinsurance businesses were reduced $1.6 billion in 2022 and $718 million in 2021 and increased $162 million in 2020. The reductions in 2022 and 2021 reflected reduced estimates for both property and casualty claims. In 2020, increases in casualty claims estimates were partly offset by reductions in property estimates. Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. These liabilities are subject to change due to changes in the legal and regulatory environment. We are unable to reliably estimate additional losses or a range of losses that are reasonably possible for these claims. Disaggregated information concerning our claims liabilities is provided below and in the pages that follow. The accident year data for Alleghany’s primary insurance business is included in Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and for its reinsurance business is included in Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) on a retrospective basis. A reconciliation of the disaggregated net unpaid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (the latter referred to as “ALAE”) of GEICO, BH Primary and BHRG to our consolidated unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2022 follows (in millions).

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated. Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply. K-93 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year below. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. Claim counts are established when accidents that may result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage. Each claim event may generate claims under multiple coverages, and thus may result in multiple counts. The “Cumulative Number of Reported Claims” includes the combined number of reported claims for all auto policy coverages.

Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year in the following tables, disaggregated by medical professional liability coverages and workers’ compensation and other casualty coverages. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. The cumulative number of reported claims reflects the number of individual claimants and includes claims that ultimately resulted in no liability or payment. Dollars are in millions. Medical Professional Liability We estimate the ultimate expected incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses for medical professional claim liabilities using a variety of commonly accepted actuarial methodologies, such as the paid and incurred development method and Bornhuetter-Ferguson based methods, as well as other techniques that consider insured loss exposures and historical and expected loss trends, among other factors. These methodologies produce loss estimates from which we determine our best estimate. In addition, we study developments in older accident years and adjust initial loss estimates to reflect recent developments based upon claim age, coverage and litigation experience.

Paid and incurred loss data is segregated and analyzed by state due to the different state regulatory frameworks that may impact certain factors, including the duration and amount of loss payments. We also separately study the various components of liabilities, such as employee lost wages, medical expenses and the costs of claims investigations and administration. We establish case liabilities for reported claims based upon the facts and circumstances of the claim. The excess of the ultimate projected losses, including the expected development of case estimates, and the case-basis liabilities is included in IBNR liabilities.

These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate. Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.K-96 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable. Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. As previously noted, Alleghany was acquired on October 19, 2022.

We establish case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim are evaluated.\nTEXT: Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or payment date. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.\nTITLE: (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\n"

These methodologies include paid and incurred loss development techniques, incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson techniques and frequency and severity techniques, as well as ground-up techniques when appropriate.\nTEXT: Our claims liabilities are principally a function of reported losses from ceding companies, case development and IBNR liability estimates. Case loss estimates are reported under our contracts either individually or in bulk as provided under the terms of the contracts. We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemed appropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.\nTITLE: (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\nTITLE: Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)\nTEXT: Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which are evaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNR liabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or is otherwise considered unreliable.\nTEXT: Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorter claim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarized by accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2022. As previously noted, Alleghany was acquired on October 19, 2022.

We believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses incepts when the contract incepts and that the classification of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include changes in estimated liabilities and related deferred charge asset amortization and adjustments arising from the changes in estimated timing and amount of future loss payments. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactive reinsurance contracts were $9.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021.\nTEXT: Paid losses and loss adjustment expenses include claim payments attributable to a contract between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, and certain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Claim payments under the AIG contract commenced in 2021 and were $1.5 billion in 2022 and $1.2 billion in 2021. Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities with regard to the AIG contract were approximately $13.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and $15.8 billion at December 31, 2021.\nTEXT: In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for many contracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.\nTEXT: Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures of approximately $12.1 billion at December 31, 2022 and $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. Retroactive reinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under these contracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims. Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible.\nTITLE: (18)Notes payable and other borrowings\nTITLE: Weighted Average December 31,\nTITLE: Weighted Average\nTITLE: December 31,\nTITLE: Interest Rate 2022 2021\nTITLE: Interest Rate\nTITLE: 2022\n"

BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In March 2022, BHFC issued $4.5 billion of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 with a weighted average interest rate of 3.4% and €1.25 billion (approximately $1.4 billion) of senior notes maturing in 2030 and 2034 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.8%. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $3.7 billion at December 31, 2022, of which $1.0 billion matured in January 2023. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.

K-103 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (20) Fair value measurements (Continued) The fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2022 follow (in millions).

In valuing the common stock warrants, we used a warrant valuation model.

Class B common stock possesses dividend and distribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B common share possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwise required under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share of Class A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class B common stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were 1,459,733 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2022 and 1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class B shares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A shares outstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B shares outstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 times average Class A shares outstanding. Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.\nTITLE: (21)Common stock\n"

The program continues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program.\nTEXT: Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) (22)Revenues from contracts with customersWe recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer.

Plan assets are generally invested with the long-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates of return on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investment returns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.

Sales, service and leasing revenues attributable to the United States were 86% in 2022, 85% in 2021 and 86% in 2020 of such amounts. The remainder of sales, service and leasing revenues were primarily in Europe, Canada and the Asia Pacific region. Railroad, utilities and energy revenues were $52.1 billion in 2022, $48.2 billion in 2021 and $41.8 billion in 2020. In each of the three years, approximately 96% of such revenues were attributable to the United States. At December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our consolidated net property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease was located in the United States with the remainder primarily in Canada and the United Kingdom.\nTEXT: (26)Contingencies and Commitments We are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods and services used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain raw materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2022, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $12 billion in 2023, $5 billion in 2024, $3 billion in 2025, $2 billion in 2026, $2 billion in 2027 and $18 billion after 2027.Since October 2017, we have owned a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee. Pilot is the largest operator of travel centers in North America (primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J) with more than 650 travel center locations across 44 U.S. states and six Canadian provinces. Pilot also has over 150 retail locations in the U.S. and Canada where it sells diesel fuel through various arrangements with third party travel centers. Through December 31, 2022, we accounted for our investment in Pilot under the equity method and the carrying value of our investment was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest for approximately $8.2 billion. This amount is based on a contractual agreement that is dependent on Pilot’s earnings for 2022 and its net debt at the end of 2022, and is subject to post-closing adjustments following the completion of Pilot’s independent public accountant’s audit of its 2022 financial statements. We obtained control of Pilot for financial reporting purposes on January 31, 2023 and, consequently, we will discontinue the use of the equity method and include Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements at that date. In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we are required to remeasure our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot to fair value as of January 31, 2023. The excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method will be recorded as a remeasurement gain. Given the proximity of the acquisition date of the additional Pilot interest to the date these Consolidated Financial Statements are issued, it was impracticable to provide an initial estimate of the fair values of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and residual goodwill or proforma information. We expect to provide such disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning with our interim report for the quarterly period ending March 31, 2023. We may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrolling interests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrolling shareholders for cash or other assets. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholders are contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. In June 2022, BHE acquired the BHE common stock held by Gregory Abel, Berkshire’s Vice Chairman - non-insurance operations, for $870 million. The purchase was pursuant to the terms of a shareholder agreement between Berkshire, BHE and BHE’s noncontrolling shareholders. Berkshire recorded a charge of $362 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the consideration paid over the carrying value of the acquired noncontrolling interest.\nTITLE: (26)Contingencies and Commitments\n"
