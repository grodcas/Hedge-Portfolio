Actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

We will adopt this standard in the fiscal year 2028 annual report.

The amended complaint asserted that NVIDIA and certain NVIDIA executives violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. Plaintiffs also alleged that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. Plaintiffs sought class certification, an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On March 2, 2021, the district court granted NVIDIA’s motion to dismiss the complaint without leave to amend, entered judgment in favor of NVIDIA and closed the case. On March 30, 2021, plaintiffs filed an appeal from judgment in the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, case number 21-15604. On August 25, 2023, a majority of a three-judge Ninth Circuit panel affirmed in part and reversed in part the district court’s dismissal of the case, with a third judge dissenting on the basis that the district court did not err in dismissing the case. On November 15, 2023, the Ninth Circuit denied NVIDIA’s petition for rehearing en banc of the Ninth Circuit panel’s majority decision to reverse in part the dismissal of the case, which NVIDIA had filed on October 10, 2023. On December 5, 2023, the Ninth Circuit granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the mandate pending NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States and the Supreme Court’s final disposition of the matter. NVIDIA filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on March 4, 2024. On June 17, 2024, the Supreme Court of the United States granted NVIDIA’s petition for a writ of certiorari. After briefing and argument, the Supreme Court dismissed NVIDIA’s writ of certiorari as improvidently granted on December 11, 2024, and issued judgment on January 13, 2025. On February 20, 2025, the Ninth Circuit’s judgment, entered August 25, 2023 and corrected August 28, 2023, took effect, and the case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\nTEXT: The putative derivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, captioned 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, initially filed January 18, 2019 and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation, was stayed pending resolution of the plaintiffs’ appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action. On February 22, 2022, the court administratively closed the case, but stated that it would reopen the case once the appeal in the In Re NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation action is resolved. The case has not yet been reopened by the court. The lawsuit asserts claims, purportedly on behalf of us, against certain officers and directors of the Company for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand.

Since our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and digital twin applications.\nTEXT: Our two operating segments are \"Compute & Networking\" and \"Graphics,\" as described in Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTEXT: Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n"

Our Blackwell architectures are the majority of our Data Center revenue.\nTEXT: The availability of data centers, energy, and capital to support the buildout of NVIDIA AI infrastructure by our customers is crucial, and any shortage of these resources could impact our future revenue and financial performance. Expanding energy capacity to meet demand is a complex, multi-year process that involves significant regulatory, technical, and construction challenges. In addition, access to capital can be particularly constrained for less-capitalized companies, which may face difficulties securing financing for large-scale infrastructure projects. These limitations could delay customer deployments or reduce the scale of accelerated computing and AI adoption.\nTEXT: We continue to execute Data Center compute product introductions, bringing new advanced architectures on a one-year product cadence. We began shipping production units of our new Blackwell Ultra platforms including GB300 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 and continue to sell prior generation architecture. The complexity of our product transitions and sophisticated system configurations may cause delays in production or create challenges in managing supply and demand. This could result in revenue volatility, quality issues, increased inventory provisions, and/or increased warranty costs. Customers may postpone purchasing new architectures or may adopt new technologies more gradually than anticipated, affecting our revenue timing and supply chain expenses.\nTEXT: In April 2025, the U.S. government, or USG, informed us that a license is required for exports of our H20 product into the China market. As a result of these new requirements, we incurred a $4.5 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026 associated with H20 for excess inventory and purchase obligations, as the demand for H20 diminished. In August 2025, the USG granted licenses that would allow us to ship certain H20 products to certain China-based customers, but to date, we have generated approximately $50 million in H20 revenue under those licenses. USG officials have expressed an expectation that the USG will receive 15% or more of the revenue generated from licensed sales of our products, but to date, the USG has not published a regulation codifying such requirement.\nTEXT: In January 2025, the USG published the “AI Diffusion” Interim Final Rule, or IFR, in the Federal Register. The IFR would have imposed a worldwide licensing requirement on our most recent data center products, such as our H200, GB200 and GB300. In May 2025, the USG announced that it would rescind the AI Diffusion IFR and implement a replacement rule. The scope, timing, and requirements of the forthcoming rule remain uncertain. The replacement rule may impose new restrictions on our products or operations and/or add license requirements that could have a material impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. For example, in October 2025, the Senate passed the “GAIN AI Act” in the National Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA. The GAIN AI Act would restrict the Trump Administration’s ability to adapt the Biden Administration’s export control rules and could also allow private U.S. persons to review and overturn licensing and foreign policy decisions made by the Trump Administration.\nTEXT: The recent rise in high-quality open-source foundation models is making advanced AI capabilities broadly accessible. Open-source AI is dependent on developer adoption and if deployed on our competitors’ platforms, it could reduce demand for our products and services.\nTEXT: The rapid evolution of global trade policies, such as export controls and tariffs, has added complexity and increased costs throughout our supply chain, and these challenges are likely to persist. Ongoing uncertainty regarding the scope and application of such measures may adversely affect investment decisions by us and our partners, disrupt supply chain operations, and impact the timing and volume of customer purchases due to challenges in forecasting future costs and demand.\nTEXT: We are increasing our U.S.-based manufacturing and investing in specialized equipment and processes to support domestic production. This move is expected to strengthen our supply chain, add resiliency and redundancy, and meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Our ability to increase manufacturing capabilities will depend on the domestic manufacturing ecosystem's capacity to ramp production supply to the required volume and on a timely basis.\nTEXT: Macroeconomic factors, including tariffs, inflation, interest rate changes, capital market volatility, global supply chain constraints, and global economic and geopolitical developments, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations, particularly demand for our products. While difficult to isolate and quantify, these macroeconomic factors impact our supply chain and manufacturing costs, employee wages, costs for capital equipment and value of our investments. Our product and solution pricing generally does not fluctuate with short-term changes in our costs. Within our supply chain, we continuously manage product availability and costs with our vendors.\nTEXT: Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n"

Certain direct customers may use either internal resources or third-party system integrators to complete their build. We refer to indirect customers as those who purchase products through our direct customers; indirect customers include CSPs, Neocloud builders, hyperscale, consumer internet companies, enterprises, and public sector entities.\nTEXT: Direct Customers – For the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, four direct customers with sales greater than 10% of total revenue included: Customer A at 22%, Customer B at 15%, Customer C at 13%, and Customer D at 11%, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2026, sales to two direct customers represented 21% and 13% of total revenue, respectively, both of which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. The customers referenced above may represent different customers than those reported in a previous period.\nTEXT: For the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, sales to three direct customers each represented 12% of total revenue, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, sales to three direct customers represented 12%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue, which were attributable to the Compute & Networking segment.\nTEXT: Indirect Customers – Indirect customer revenue is an estimation based upon multiple factors including customer purchase order information, product specifications, internal sales data, and other sources. Indirect customers primarily purchase our products through system integrators and distributors.\nTEXT: We generate a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of indirect customers, some individually representing 10% or more of our revenue. Certain companies purchase cloud and related services through various direct and indirect customers. We estimate that one AI research and deployment company contributed to a meaningful amount of our revenue purchasing cloud services from our customers in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026. Our revenue is concentrated among a limited number of direct, indirect and cloud service purchasers and this trend may continue.\nTEXT: Revenue by geographic region is designated based on the location of the customers' headquarters of direct customers even if the estimated revenue may be attributable to indirect customers in a different location. Revenue from sales to customers headquartered outside of the United States accounted for 31% and 34% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively, and 44% and 41% of total revenue for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.\nTITLE: Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nTEXT: Gross profit consists of total net revenue less cost of revenue. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors, including wafer fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging, board and device costs, manufacturing support costs, including labor and overhead associated with such purchases, final test yield fallout, inventory and warranty provisions, memory and component costs, tariffs, and shipping costs. Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\nTEXT: Gross margins decreased to 73.4% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2026 compared to 74.6% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, and 69.3% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 compared to 75.8% for the first nine months of fiscal year 2025, as our business model transitioned from offering Hopper HGX systems to Blackwell full-scale datacenter solutions. Gross margin for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026 was also impacted by a $4.5 billion charge associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations.\nTEXT: Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $410 million and $6.7 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively, including $4.5 billion associated with H20 excess inventory and purchase obligations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $366 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The net effect on our gross margin was an unfavorable impact of 0.1% and 3.7% in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively.\nTEXT: Provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $865 million and $2.2 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively. Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $106 million and $305 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2025, respectively.

Refer to Notes 5 and 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information regarding our investments in non-marketable equity securities and publicly-held equity securities.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: Income tax expense was $6.0 billion and $3.0 billion for the third quarter, and $13.9 billion and $8.0 billion for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively. Income tax as a percentage of income before income tax was an expense of 15.9% and 13.5% for the third quarter, and 15.3% and 13.6% for the first nine months, of fiscal years 2026 and 2025, respectively.\nTEXT: The effective tax rate increased primarily due to a lower percentage of tax benefits from stock-based compensation and U.S. federal research tax credit relative to the increase in income before income tax.\nTEXT: Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2026 and 2025 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to tax benefits from foreign-derived deduction eligible income, stock-based compensation, income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes at rates lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the U.S. federal research tax credit.\nTEXT: In July 2025, the OBBBA was enacted into law and contains several changes to key U.S. federal income tax laws. We have recognized the tax effects of currently effective OBBBA provisions, which are not material and are reflected in our results for the first nine months of fiscal year 2026. We will continue to evaluate the impact of these legislative changes as tax authorities provide additional guidance and interpretation.\nTEXT: Given our current and possible future earnings, we believe that we may release the valuation allowance associated with certain state deferred tax assets in the near term, which would decrease our income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The timing and amount of the valuation allowance release could vary based on our assessment of all available information.\nTEXT: Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.\n"

As of October 26, 2025, we had $60.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.

Our tax payments in fiscal year 2026 will decrease due to currently effective OBBBA provisions.\nTITLE: Capital Return to Shareholders\nTEXT: We repurchased 70 million and 262 million shares of our common stock for $12.6 billion and $36.7 billion during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively.

Our share repurchase program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.\nTEXT: We paid cash dividends to our shareholders of $243 million and $732 million during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2026, respectively. The payment of future cash dividends is subject to our Board of Directors' continuing determination that the declaration of dividends is in the best interests of our shareholders.\nTEXT: The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 requires a 1% excise tax on certain share repurchases in excess of shares issued for employee compensation made after December 31, 2022.
