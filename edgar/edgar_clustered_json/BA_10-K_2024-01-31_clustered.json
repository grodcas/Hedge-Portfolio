We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.\nTEXT: Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) and Global Services (BGS). BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, quality, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions.\nTITLE: Business Environment and Trends\nTEXT: In 2023, global air traffic largely recovered to 2019 levels with domestic travel continuing to be the most robust and the single-aisle market following closely. International travel has mostly recovered and the wide-body market continues to be paced by the international travel recovery. The transition in the international commercial market from recovery to normal market conditions is progressing slowly as China international travel remains below 2019 levels. We are experiencing strong demand from our airline customers globally.\nTEXT: We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTEXT: Airline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has benefited from the resilient demand for travel. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2023 industry-wide profit of $23.3 billion, up from its forecast of $4.6 billion a year ago, primarily driven by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2024, IATA is forecasting $25.7 billion in profits for the industry globally. The overall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and volatile cost of fuel and tight labor conditions. The global economy is expecting an easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial viability of some airlines and regions.\nTEXT: The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.5% growth rate in the global fleet over a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6% in average annual gross domestic product, we\nTEXT: project demand for approximately 42,595 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.\nTEXT: At BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. We continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price development programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.\nTEXT: At BGS, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recovered and transitions to growth. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable.\n"

Congress and the President must enact either full-year fiscal year 2024 (FY24) appropriations bills or an additional Continuing Resolution to fund government departments and agencies after these dates, or a partial or full government shutdown could result. U.S. government discretionary spending in FY24 and 2025 (FY25), including defense spending, was capped by the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA). Additionally, a Continuing Resolution for FY24 or FY25 in place on April 30 of the relevant fiscal year, would trigger a sequester under the FRA.\nTEXT: Global Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the Company.\nTEXT: The current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. Since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. We are mitigating import costs through Duty Drawback Customs procedures. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft and we have long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.\nTEXT: Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. The U.S. has subsequently reached agreements with Mexico, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, to ease or remove tariffs on steel and/or aluminum. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.\nTEXT: We are complying with all U.S. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions imposed on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other governments, as well as any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.\nTEXT: Supply Chain We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTEXT: The current conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip has the potential to impact certain of our suppliers, and has impacted some operations for our airline and lessor customers. We are closely monitoring developments, supporting our employees and customers, and will take mitigating actions as appropriate.\nTITLE: Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nTITLE: Commercial Airplanes\nTITLE: Business Environment and Trends\nTEXT: Airline Industry Environment See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the airline industry environment.\nTEXT: Industry Competitiveness The commercial aircraft market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 78% of BCA’s total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), which delivered its first C919 aircraft in 2022. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.\n"

Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and Boeing customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\nTEXT: BCA total backlog of $440,507 million at December 31, 2023 increased from $329,824 million at December 31, 2022, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries and a decrease in the value of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by order cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2023 totaled $12,925 million and primarily relate to 737 and 777X aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in an increase to backlog of $20,605 million primarily due to a net decrease of 777X and 737 aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If we are unable to deliver aircraft to customers in China consistent with our assumptions, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations.\nTEXT: Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.\nTEXT: The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.\nTEXT: The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31.

We are currently producing at a rate of 38 per month.\nTEXT: On January 5, 2024, an Alaska Airlines 737-9 flight made an emergency landing after a mid-exit door plug detached in flight. Following the accident, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded and required inspections of all 737-9 aircraft with a mid-exit door plug, which constitute the large majority of the approximately 220 737-9 aircraft in the in-service fleet. On January 24, 2024, the FAA approved an enhanced maintenance and inspection process that must be performed on each of the grounded 737-9 aircraft. Our 737-9 operators have begun returning their fleets to service, and many 737-9s have completed inspections and resumed revenue flights. All 737-9 aircraft in production will undergo this same enhanced inspection process prior to delivery.\nTEXT: On January 10, 2024, the FAA notified Boeing that the FAA has initiated an investigation into Boeing’s quality control system.

We continue to work with the FAA on open actions to support 737-7 certification. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the 737-10 program received approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are now planning to incorporate engineering solutions to the de-icing systems on the 737-7 and 737-10, which will delay certification and first deliveries.\nTEXT: We are currently unable to reasonably estimate what impact the accident, the related FAA actions and certification delays will have on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of 2023, we discovered non-conforming holes in the aft pressure dome of certain 737-7, 737-8 and 737 military derivative aircraft. Rework on non-conforming fuselages with our supplier is complete and newly built aircraft meet our specifications. We do not expect inspection of completed aircraft in inventory to result in significant rework or production disruption.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 140 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including 85 aircraft for customers in China. Return-to-service of the China 737 MAX fleet is complete. While there continues to be uncertainty, we are continuing to work with airlines and government officials on delivery timing and expect to deliver most of the aircraft in inventory by the end of 2024. In the event that we are unable to deliver aircraft consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 7, Note 13 and Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 747 Program We completed production of the 747 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and delivery of the last aircraft occurred in February 2023. Ending production of the 747 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTEXT: 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2023 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. The commercial program has near break-even gross margins.

We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs.\nTEXT: We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process including obtaining approval from the FAA to begin certification flight testing. We expect the first delivery of the 777-9 to occur in 2025 and the 777-8 freighter to occur in 2027. First delivery of the 777-8 passenger aircraft is not expected to occur before 2030.\nTEXT: In April 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777-9 during 2022 and 2023, which resulted in cumulative abnormal production costs of $0.8 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the 777X program resumed production.\nTEXT: The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further\nTEXT: production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had approximately 50 and 90 aircraft in inventory that require rework which we expect to complete by the end of 2024.\nTEXT: Beginning in 2021, the 787 program lowered production rates and paused deliveries in order to improve production quality and implement changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built aircraft meet our specifications. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates. This resulted in abnormal production costs, which we expensed as incurred through the third quarter of 2023. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2023 totaled $2.7 billion. The costs associated with the remaining rework are not expected to be significant.\nTEXT: Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\nTITLE: Additional Considerations\nTEXT: The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, operational and supply chain challenges, achieving anticipated cost reductions, additional regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.\nTITLE: Defense, Space & Security\nTITLE: Business Environment and Trends\nTITLE: United States Government Defense Environment Overview\nTEXT: In March 2023, the U.S. government released the President's budget request for FY24, which requested $842 billion in funding for the U.S. DoD and $27 billion for NASA.

The decrease is primarily due to $2,863 million of lower charges in 2023 on fixed-price development programs that were partially offset by lower earnings across other programs including satellites and F-15, as well as higher period expenses. During 2023, losses incurred on the five fixed-price development programs totaled $1,585 million compared with $4,448 million in 2022.

Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates, or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nTEXT: Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\nTITLE: Global Services\n"

The legacy three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025, which consists of $3.0 billion of total commitments, and the legacy five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in October 2024, as amended, which consists of $3.2 billion of total commitments, each remain in effect. We anticipate that these credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.\nTEXT: Our credit ratings were downgraded in 2020 and remained unchanged as of December 31, 2023. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Fitch upgraded our credit rating outlook from stable to positive driven by declining inventory levels, improving production and delivery profile, growing backlog, and forecasted positive free cash flow. During the third quarter of 2023, S&P upgraded the outlook on our credit rating from negative to stable primarily driven by improving deliveries and expected increases in production. During the first quarter of 2023, Moody's upgraded the outlook on our credit rating from negative to stable primarily driven by an improvement in operating cash flow and a reduction of 737 and 787 aircraft in inventory.\nTEXT: We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades such as those we experienced in 2020. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments.\nTEXT: Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.\nTEXT: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.\nTEXT: At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our pension plans were $5.4 billion and $5.3 billion underfunded as measured under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). On an ERISA basis, our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2023. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2024. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.\nTEXT: For the foreseeable future, we are using common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans.\nTEXT: Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n"

The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.\nTEXT: Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities, including accrued compensation.\nTEXT: We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in some instances, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2023, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2023, we had outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $24.5 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.\nTEXT: Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees.

Customer financing commitments totaled $17.0 billion and $16.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022. The increase relates to new financing commitments. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Contingent Obligations\nTEXT: We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:\nTEXT: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us.

These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings/(loss) per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial\nTEXT: assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nTEXT: The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $799 million in 2023, $849 million in 2022 and $882 million in 2021. The lower benefits in 2023 and 2022 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $529 million in 2023, $881 million in 2022 and $528 million in 2021. The lower benefits in 2023 were primarily due to higher interest cost and lower expected return on plan assets, offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses. The higher benefits in 2022 were primarily due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses and a settlement loss that was recorded in 2021. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 26 of this Form 10-K and see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: Management uses core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margin and core earnings/(loss) per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.\nTITLE: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures\nTEXT: The table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings/(loss), core operating margins and core earnings/(loss) per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of Earnings/(loss) from operations, operating margins and Diluted earnings/(loss) per share.\nTEXT: (Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31, 202320222021Revenues$77,794 $66,608 $62,286 Loss from operations, as reported($773)($3,519)($2,870)Operating margins(1.0)%(5.3)%(4.6)%Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($799)($849)($882)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(257)(294)(291)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($1,056)($1,143)($1,173)Core operating loss (non-GAAP)($1,829)($4,662)($4,043)Core operating margins (non-GAAP)(2.4)%(7.0)%(6.5)%Diluted loss per share, as reported($3.67)($8.30)($7.15)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(1.32)(1.43)(1.50)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(0.42)(0.49)(0.49)Non-operating pension expense(2)(0.87)(1.47)(0.91)Non-operating postretirement expense(2)(0.10)(0.10) Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (3)0.57 0.73 0.61 Core loss per share (non-GAAP)($5.81)($11.06)($9.44)Weighted average diluted shares (in millions)606.1 595.2 588.0\nTABLE: TABLE: Years ended December 31, 2023 2022 2021; Revenues $77,794 $66,608 $62,286; Loss from operations, as reported ($773) ($3,519) ($2,870); Operating margins (1.0) % (5.3) % (4.6) %; Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1) ($799) ($849) ($882); Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1) (257) (294) (291); FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1) ($1,056) ($1,143) ($1,173); Core operating loss (non-GAAP) ($1,829) ($4,662) ($4,043); Core operating margins (non-GAAP) (2.4) % (7.0) % (6.5) %; Diluted loss per share, as reported ($3.67) ($8.30) ($7.15); Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1) (1.32) (1.43) (1.50); Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1) (0.42) (0.49) (0.49); Non-operating pension expense(2) (0.87) (1.47) (0.91); Non-operating postretirement expense(2) (0.10) (0.10); Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (3) 0.57 0.73 0.61; Core loss per share (non-GAAP) ($5.81) ($11.06) ($9.44); Weighted average diluted shares (in millions) 606.1 595.2 588.0.\nTITLE: Years ended December 31, 202320222021\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Revenues$77,794 $66,608 $62,286\nTITLE: $77,794\nTITLE: Loss from operations, as reported($773)($3,519)($2,870)\nTITLE: ($773)\nTITLE: Operating margins(1.0)%(5.3)%(4.6)%\nTITLE: (1.0)\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($799)($849)($882)\nTEXT: Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)\nTITLE: ($799)\n"

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.\nTEXT: Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total revenue, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\nTEXT: Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total revenue estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award fee provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on the estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, global supply chain constraints, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.\nTEXT: Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $2,943 million, $5,253 million and $880 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and were primarily due to losses recognized on the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\nTEXT: Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, internal and supplier performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2023, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.\n"

A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for\nTEXT: delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\nTEXT: Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and supplier performance trends, production quality, labor instability, global supply chain constraints, learning curve, change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.\nTEXT: The introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, certification, and production schedules. These challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.\nTEXT: To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\nTEXT: The 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2023. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.\nTEXT: Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have an approximately $330 million impact on operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nTITLE: Pension Plans\nTEXT: Many of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.\nTEXT: The projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $1,280 million or increase by $1,425 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2023 net periodic pension cost by $150 million. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.\n"

The Company had deferred income tax liabilities of $10,363 million at December 31, 2023 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.\nTEXT: On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\nTEXT: This assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.\nTEXT: Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $4,550 million at December 31, 2023 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax net operating losses, tax credits and interest carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. During 2023, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $1,388 million primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2023 that cannot be realized in 2023. Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.\nTEXT: For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note 22, we now operate in three reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS). As a result, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n"

For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial aircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.\nTEXT: Payments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order and additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract.\nTEXT: Long-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft, cybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems and modification of commercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Sales of services under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance agreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.\nTEXT: For each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative standalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide. While the scope and price on certain long-term contracts may be modified over their life, the transaction price is based on current rights and obligations under the contract and does not include potential modifications until they are agreed upon with the customer. When applicable, a cumulative adjustment or separate recognition for the additional scope and price may result. Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price variable consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price represents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\nTEXT: Long-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as services are rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of control to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take control of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced either by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products or services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.\nTEXT: The accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total revenues, costs and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-term contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\nTEXT: For long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total revenues and costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is recognized.\nTEXT: The table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended December 31:\nTEXT: 202320222021Decrease to Revenue($1,706)($2,335)($379)Increase to Loss from operations ($2,943)($5,253)($880)Increase to Diluted loss per share($5.43)($8.88)($1.28)\n"

The U.S. government customer typically withholds payment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long-term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables (contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances and progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the Company in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.\nTEXT: Commercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts. For each contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair value. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part performance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare part where a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination of these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.\nTEXT: Other service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including maintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time as the services are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.\nTEXT: Concession sharing arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance obligations. The sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. We record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of products.\nTEXT: Unbilled receivables and advances and progress billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes revenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables or Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.\nTEXT: Financial services revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type leases, operating leases and loans in Sales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type leases, we recognize selling profit or loss at lease inception if collection of the lease payments is probable. For sales-type leases, we record financing receivables at lease inception. A financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. For notes receivable, we record financing receivables net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.\nTEXT: Income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables that are uncollectible. We determine that a financing receivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. We determine a financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date specified in the contract.\nTEXT: We evaluate the collectability of financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a financing receivable is determined to be uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement, sales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If we have a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that changes to non-accrual status after commencement, we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is sufficient collateral and payments exceed past due principal payments.\n"

Actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.\nTEXT: For operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets, included in Financing receivables and operating lease equipment, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset. We periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense. We record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We evaluate for impairment assets under operating leases when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nTEXT: Reinsurance revenue Our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, Astro Ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers’ compensation. The member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members’ individual risk. Reinsurance revenues were $163, $129 and $126 during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $181, $134 and $129 during 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Revenues and costs are presented net in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTITLE: Research and Development\nTEXT: Research and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our long-term contract accounting policy. We have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. Accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. Research and development expense, net included bid and proposal costs of $188, $217 and $213 in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nTITLE: Share-Based Compensation\nTEXT: We provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. For awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated\nTEXT: forfeitures. For awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. The expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: Provisions for U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. income taxes are calculated on reported Loss before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.\nTEXT: The accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of Income tax (expense)/benefit.\nTEXT: We also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized. Changes in our estimates and judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets may result in an increase or decrease to our tax expense and/or other comprehensive income, which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs.\n"

The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employee’s annual earnings. The net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). Actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in Shareholders’ equity (net of taxes). If actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities, we amortize them over the average expected future lifetime of participants. The funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nTITLE: Postemployment Plans\nTEXT: We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.\nTITLE: Environmental Remediation\nTEXT: We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. Our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. Estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. We may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. Such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.\nTITLE: Cash and Cash Equivalents\nTEXT: Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. We aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to Accounts payable. Negative balances reclassified to Accounts payable were $117 and $102 at December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n"

To the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. Inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. Included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.\nTEXT: Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. Deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. Higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative aircraft program. Units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. We expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. Supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. As parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.\nTEXT: The determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. When actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. The determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. When estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.\nTEXT: Used aircraft purchased by our BCA segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. Spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. We review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. Impaired inventories are charged to Cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.\nTEXT: Included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. Early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. If an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. However, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.\nTITLE: Precontract Costs\nTEXT: We may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. If we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. Capitalized precontract costs are included in Inventories in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.\n"

Assets under finance leases, which primarily represent computer equipment, are included in Property, plant and equipment, net, with the related liabilities included in Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nTEXT: Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the lease term. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate in\nTEXT: determining the present value of lease payments. Variable components of the lease payments such as fair market value adjustments, utilities and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and not included in determining the present value. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nTEXT: We have real property lease agreements with lease and non-lease components which are accounted for as a single lease component.\nTITLE: Asset Retirement Obligations\nTEXT: We record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. Recorded amounts are not material.\nTEXT: We also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. Accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements. A liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liability’s fair value. In addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Our annual testing date is April 1.\nTEXT: We test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the quantitative test is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.\nTEXT: Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of a brand and trade name and in-process research and development (IPR&D) acquired in business combinations. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. IPR&D is reclassified to finite-lived acquired intangible assets when a project is completed and then amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated useful life. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing the carrying values to current projections of related discounted cash flows. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.\nTEXT: Our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 4 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 17 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 1 to 32 years. We evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.

Available-for-sale debt investments are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt investments are recognized based on the specific identification method. Available-for-sale debt investments are assessed for impairment quarterly.\nTEXT: The equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%. The cumulative earnings approach is used for cash flow classification of distributions received from equity method investments.\nTEXT: Other Equity investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes. Equity investments without readily determinable fair value are assessed for impairment quarterly.\nTEXT: We classify investment income and loss on our Consolidated Statements of Operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. Operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. Earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from other equity investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in Income/(loss) from operating investments, net. Non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes.

We also hold certain other derivative instruments for economic purposes. These aluminum purchase and sale agreements and other derivative instruments are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. For these aluminum agreements and other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately.\n"

The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors such as customer credit ratings, bankruptcy filings, published or\nTEXT: estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates and collateral exposures. Collateral exposure is the excess of the carrying value of a financial asset over the fair value of the related collateral. We determine the creditworthiness of our customers by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by major credit rating agencies.\nTEXT: Financing receivables are collateralized by security in the related asset. We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft collateral. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.\nTEXT: We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.\nTITLE: Commercial Aircraft Trade-in Commitments\nTEXT: In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new commercial aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price.\nTEXT: Exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:\nTEXT: (1)adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the Sale Aircraft, and/or\nTEXT: (2)charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for Sale Aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. Estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in Accrued liabilities.\nTEXT: The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements; or the scrap market. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.\n"

The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard\nTEXT: warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. These warranties are included in the programs’ estimate at completion. On occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. Warranties issued by our BDS segment principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons systems. These sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two-year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery occurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\nTEXT: We provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. These performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in estimates to complete the related programs.\nTITLE: Supplier Penalties\nTEXT: We may incur penalties to suppliers under certain circumstances such as a contract termination. We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable we will incur a supplier penalty and the amount is reasonably estimable.\nTITLE: Guarantees\nTEXT: At the inception of a guarantee, we record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of the guarantee. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor’s default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable. We also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss at inception and adjust it each quarter.\nTITLE: Balance at December 31, 2022$1,316 $3,224 $3,432 $85 $8,057\nTITLE: $1,316\nTITLE: $3,224\nTITLE: $3,432\nTITLE: $85\nTITLE: $8,057\nTITLE: Acquisitions3 11 16 30\nTITLE: 3\nTITLE: 11\nTITLE: 16\nTITLE: 30\nTITLE: Goodwill adjustments6 6\nTITLE: 6\nTITLE: Balance at December 31, 2023$1,319 $3,235 $3,454 $85 $8,093\nTITLE: $1,319\nTITLE: $3,235\nTITLE: $3,454\nTITLE: $85\nTITLE: $8,093\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had indefinite-lived intangible assets with carrying amounts of $197 relating to trade names.

The Company’s deferred income tax liabilities of $10,363 will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated tax net operating losses in 2021 and interest carryovers in 2021, 2022, and 2023 that can be carried forward indefinitely and federal research and development credits that can be carried forward 20 years.\nTEXT: Throughout 2021, 2022, and 2023, the Company was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $4,550 and $3,162 primarily for certain domestic deferred tax assets, and certain domestic net operating losses, tax\nTEXT: credit and interest carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the Company estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate the reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax deductions over the next 15 to 20 years. The valuation allowance results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability reversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.\nTEXT: During 2023, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $1,388, primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2023 that cannot be realized in 2023. This reflects a tax expense of $1,150 recorded in continuing operations, an increase of $31 related to the associated federal benefit of state impacts, a tax expense of $173 included in Other comprehensive income (OCI) primarily due to the net actuarial losses that resulted from the annual remeasurement of pension assets and liabilities, and an increase of $34 included in additional paid-in capital.\nTEXT: Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI.\nTEXT: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act one-time repatriation tax and Global Intangible Low Tax Income liabilities effectively taxed the undistributed earnings previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. We have not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If such earnings were to be distributed, any deferred income taxes would not be significant.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were not significant. The amounts of interest included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were not significant for 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nTEXT: A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nTEXT: 202320222021Unrecognized tax benefits – January 1$915 $858 $966 Gross increases – tax positions in prior periods38 17 64 Gross decreases – tax positions in prior periods(3)(51)(245)Gross increases – current period tax positions181 91 73 Gross decreases – current period tax positionsUnrecognized tax benefits – December 31$1,131 $915 $858\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Gross increases – tax positions in prior periods — 2023: 38; 2022: 17; 2021: 64\nTABLE_ROW: Gross decreases – tax positions in prior periods — 2023: (3); 2022: (51); 2021: (245)\nTABLE_ROW: Gross increases – current period tax positions — 2023: 181; 2022: 91; 2021: 73\nTITLE: 202320222021\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Unrecognized tax benefits – January 1$915 $858 $966\nTITLE: $915\nTITLE: Gross increases – tax positions in prior periods38 17 64\nTITLE: 38\nTITLE: Gross decreases – tax positions in prior periods(3)(51)(245)\nTITLE: (3)\nTITLE: Gross increases – current period tax positions181 91 73\nTITLE: 181\nTITLE: Unrecognized tax benefits – December 31$1,131 $915 $858\n"

As of December 31, 2023, these amounts were primarily associated with the amount of research tax credits claimed and various other matters.\nTEXT: Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2018. The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the 2018-2020 tax years. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2010-2022 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.\nTEXT: Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, unrecognized tax benefits related to federal tax matters under audit may decrease by up to $620 based on current estimates.\nTEXT: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the US has not yet adopted the Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation. As currently designed, Pillar Two will ultimately apply to our worldwide operations. Considering we do not have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum, these rules are not expected to materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules. We will continue to monitor US and global legislative action related to Pillar Two for potential impacts.\nTITLE: 20232022\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: U.S. government contracts(1)$970 $800\nTITLE: $970\nTITLE: Commercial Airplanes57 293\nTITLE: 57\nTITLE: Global Services(2)1,526 1,390\nTITLE: 1,526\nTITLE: Defense, Space, & Security(2)160 145\nTITLE: 160\nTITLE: Other25 5\nTITLE: 25\nTITLE: Less valuation allowance(89)(116)\nTITLE: (89)\nTITLE: Total$2,649 $2,517\nTITLE: $2,649\nTEXT: (1)Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government\nTEXT: (2)Excludes U.S. government contracts\nTITLE: Accounts receivableUnbilled receivablesOther Current AssetsFinancing receivablesOther AssetsTotal\nTITLE: Accounts receivable\nTITLE: Unbilled receivables\nTITLE: Other Current Assets\nTITLE: Financing receivables\nTITLE: Other Assets\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Balance at January 1, 2023($116)($23)($85)($55)($88)($367)\nTITLE: ($116)\nTITLE: ($23)\nTITLE: ($85)\nTITLE: ($55)\nTITLE: ($88)\nTITLE: ($367)\nTITLE: Changes in estimates(6)4 30 4 (34)(2)\nTITLE: (6)\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: 30\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: (34)\nTITLE: (2)\nTITLE: Write-offs29 5 34\nTITLE: 29\nTITLE: 5\nTITLE: 34\nTITLE: Recoveries4 4\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: Balance at December 31, 2023($89)($19)($50)($51)($122)($331)\nTITLE: ($89)\nTITLE: ($19)\nTITLE: ($50)\nTITLE: ($51)\nTITLE: ($122)\nTITLE: ($331)\nTITLE: 20232022\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Commercial aircraft programs$68,683 $67,702\nTITLE: $68,683\nTITLE: Long-term contracts in progress686 582\nTITLE: 686\nTITLE: Capitalized precontract costs(1)946 794\nTEXT: Capitalized precontract costs(1)\nTITLE: 946\nTITLE: Commercial spare parts, used aircraft, general stock materials and other9,426 9,073\nTITLE: 9,426\nTITLE: Total$79,741 $78,151\nTITLE: $79,741\nTEXT: (1) Capitalized precontract costs at December 31, 2023 and 2022 includes amounts related to KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, and T-7A Red Hawk Production Options.

It is reasonably possible that we may incur costs that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than\nTEXT: expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated.

The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement and require advance notice by the customer.\nTEXT: Trade-in commitment agreements at December 31, 2023 have expiration dates from 2024 through 2030. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,415 and $1,117. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $407 and $286, and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $407 and $286.\nTITLE: Financing Commitments\nTEXT: Financing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, and refinancing of delivered aircraft, totaled $17,003 and $16,105 as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Although we do not use COLI currently, these obligations from the merger with McDonnell Douglas are still a commitment at this time. We have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the cash surrender value was $360 and $376 and the total loans were $334 and $346. As we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in Other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nTITLE: Supply Chain Financing Programs\nTEXT: The Company has supply chain financing programs in place under which participating suppliers may elect to obtain payment from an intermediary. The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on invoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within 30 to 90 days but may extend up to 12 months. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Accounts payable included $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in these programs. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing would have a significant impact on our liquidity.\nTITLE: Government Assistance\nTEXT: Certain states and localities in which we operate offer or have offered various business incentives related to investment and/or job creation. Between 2010 and 2016, we received cash grants totaling $346 related to our investment in operations in South Carolina. The grants were recorded in Accrued liabilities and are being amortized, primarily to inventory, over the useful life of the Property, plant and equipment extending through 2052. During 2023 and 2022, we amortized $10 and $11 to Inventories, and recorded a benefit of $12 and $5 in cost of sales. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, Inventories included a benefit of $62 and $64 and Accrued liabilities included a balance of $97 and $106.\nTEXT: We are eligible to claim tax refunds from the State of Missouri and City of Irving, Texas primarily related to job creation and retention through 2031.

As of December 31, 2023, $60 of refunds, plus interest, is subject to clawback if we fail to meet certain conditions, including employment levels.\nTEXT: We are eligible to claim cash grants through 2032 of up to $62, related to operations in Queensland, Australia. During 2023 and 2022, $5 and $7 cash was received and recorded as a benefit in cost of sales. At December 31, 2023, $4 is subject to clawback if we fail to meet certain conditions, including employment levels.\nTEXT: Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by St. Louis County and the city of St. Charles, Missouri were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our St. Louis and St. Charles sites. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include twelve-year property tax abatements and sales tax exemptions from St. Louis County and a 22 year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from the city of St. Charles. We record these properties on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We have also purchased the IRBs, and therefore, are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the IRB proceeds. The liabilities and IRB assets are equal and are reported net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the assets and liabilities associated with the IRBs were $333 and $271.\nTITLE: Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts\nTEXT: Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government.\nTITLE: Fixed-Price Contracts\nTEXT: Long-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, services and related technologies. This development work scope is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work by us and our suppliers. The operational and technical complexities of fixed-price development contracts create financial risk, which could trigger additional earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\n"

During 2022, we increased\nTEXT: the reach-forward loss on the contract by $1,452. This year we made progress completing engineering and production requirements. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $482 driven by engineering changes to support the build and installation process; the resolution of supplier negotiations; and factory performance related to labor instability. While we have provisioned for all of our anticipated costs to complete the contract, risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: KC-46A Tanker\nTEXT: In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers as well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized ten low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 139 aircraft, including lots 9 and 10 that were authorized in 2023. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $27 billion as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: During 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $1,374. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $309 primarily resulting from factory disruption and additional rework due to a supplier quality issue. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $125 of capitalized precontract costs and $48 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unexercised future lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: MQ-25\nTEXT: In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of seven aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 in the third quarter of 2018. During 2022, we increased the MQ-25 reach-forward loss by $579. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $231 primarily driven by production and flight testing delays as well as higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft attributable to recent factory performance. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options\nTEXT: In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $860 fixed-price contract and includes five aircraft and seven simulators. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded earnings charges of $203 related to the T-7A Red Hawk fixed-price EMD contract, which had a reach-forward loss at December 31, 2022. The production portion of the contract includes 11 production lots for aircraft and related services for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. We expect the first production and support contract option to be exercised in 2025. During 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss by $552. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $275 primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $185 of capitalized precontract costs and $249 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: Commercial Crew\nTEXT: National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station and in the second quarter of 2022 we successfully completed the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test. During 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss by $288. During 2023, we also increased the reach-forward loss by $288 primarily as a result of delaying the crewed flight test previously scheduled for July 2023 following\nTEXT: notification by a parachute supplier of an issue identified through testing. A crewed flight test is now planned for April 2024. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $226 of capitalized precontract costs and $160 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unauthorized future missions.

Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.\nTEXT: If a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent repurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.\nTEXT: Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit.

The yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. Bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. The present value of each plan’s benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.\nTEXT: The pension fund’s expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. While consideration is given to historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. As of December 31, 2023, the MRVA was approximately $8,466 more than the fair market value of assets.\nTEXT: Assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:\nTEXT: December 31,202320222021Health care cost trend rate assumed next year5.50 %5.50 %4.50 %Ultimate trend rate4.50 %4.50 %4.50 %Year that trend reaches ultimate rate202820282021\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Health care cost trend rate assumed next year — 2023: 5.50; 2022: 5.50; 2021: 4.50\nTABLE_ROW: Ultimate trend rate — 2023: 4.50; 2022: 4.50; 2021: 4.50\nTABLE_ROW: Year that trend reaches ultimate rate — 2023: 2028; 2022: 2028; 2021: 2021\nTITLE: December 31,202320222021\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Health care cost trend rate assumed next year5.50 %5.50 %4.50 %\nTITLE: 5.50\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Ultimate trend rate4.50 %4.50 %4.50 %\nTITLE: 4.50\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Year that trend reaches ultimate rate202820282021\nTITLE: 2028\n"

Specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\nTEXT: We periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of our strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2023, we completed a strategy review including an asset/liability study and, as a result, target allocations were updated with a modest increase to risk assets. The changes in the asset allocation are reflected in the table below. We identify investment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. Short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced frequently. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31 were as follows:\nTEXT: Actual AllocationsTarget AllocationsAsset Class2023202220232022Fixed income60 %63 %59 %63 %Global equity19 14 20 20 Private equity8 8 7 4 Real estate and real assets7 8 7 7 Hedge funds6 7 7 6 Total100 %100 %100 %100 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Actual Allocations Target Allocations; Asset Class 2023 2022 2023 2022; Fixed income 60 % 63 % 59 % 63 %; Global equity 19 14 20 20; Private equity 8 8 7 4; Real estate and real assets 7 8 7 7; Hedge funds 6 7 7 6; Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %.\nTITLE: Asset Class2023202220232022\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Fixed income60 %63 %59 %63 %\nTITLE: 60\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 59\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Global equity19 14 20 20\nTITLE: 19\nTITLE: 20\nTITLE: Private equity8 8 7 4\nTITLE: 8\nTITLE: 7\nTITLE: Real estate and real assets7 8 7 7\nTITLE: 7\nTITLE: Hedge funds6 7 7 6\nTITLE: 6\nTITLE: 7\nTITLE: Total100 %100 %100 %100 %\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 100\n"

Liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. Further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. Investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. Credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. Valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.\nTEXT: Fair Value Measurements The following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value.

All of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. In the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. Common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments.\nTEXT: Private equity and private debt NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data.

The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors.

We expect approximately 16% to be converted to revenue through 2024 and approximately 62% through 2027, with the remainder thereafter.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n"

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nTITLE: Cost Estimates for Fixed-Price Development Contracts - Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statements\nTEXT: Critical Audit Matter Description\nTEXT: As more fully described in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue over time for long-term contracts as goods are produced or services are rendered. The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and revenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion involves estimating the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue amount. Margins on fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability. The operational and technical complexities of fixed-price development contracts create financial risk, which could increase the estimates of costs and result in lower margins or material reach-forward losses. The ongoing effects of supply chain and labor disruption compound these complexities and related financial risks.\nTEXT: Given the operational and technical complexities of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 contracts and the limited amount of historical data available in certain instances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\nTEXT: How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nTEXT: Our audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\nTEXT: •We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.\nTEXT: •We evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and schedule estimates, including the effects of supply chain and labor disruptions. We also evaluated the range and probabilities of reasonably possible outcomes, and where management set its point estimate within the range.\nTEXT: •We evaluated the appropriateness of the timing of the incorporation of changes to key estimates, including evaluating the timeline of key events and knowledge points that led to management’s determination that a change in estimate was necessary.\nTEXT: •We inquired of project management, engineers, supply chain leadership, and others directly involved with the execution of contracts to evaluate management’s ability to achieve the key\nTEXT: cost and schedule estimates, as well as evaluate project status and challenges which may affect total estimated costs to complete.\nTEXT: •We observed the project work site when key estimates related to tangible or physical progress of the project.\nTEXT: •We tested the accuracy and completeness of the key data used in developing estimates. We developed independent expectations of reasonable outcomes using, in part, the program’s data and compared our expectations to management’s estimates.\nTEXT: •We performed retrospective reviews when evaluating the thoroughness and precision of management’s estimation process and effectiveness of the related internal controls by comparing actual outcomes to previous estimates and the related financial statement impact, and evaluating key judgements made by management when determining the timing of changes to key estimates.\nTEXT: •We tested the effectiveness of internal controls including, those over the review of significant judgments made and assumptions used to develop key estimates, key data used in developing the estimates and the mathematical extrapolation of such data.\n"

The Company uses program accounting to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program accounting requires estimating the costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, the level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, including potential delays in the timing of achieving certification that would delay entry into service and corresponding increases in estimated costs. Changes to the cost estimates related to regulatory requirements to achieve certification could occur, resulting in lower margins or material reach-forward losses. Auditing these estimated costs for the 777X program involved extensive audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\nTEXT: How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nTEXT: Our audit procedures related to the estimated costs for the 777X program included the following, among others:\nTEXT: •We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its cost estimates related to regulatory requirements to achieve certification.\nTEXT: •We performed procedures to evaluate new changes in estimated costs driven by changes in regulatory requirements to achieve certification.\nTEXT: •We evaluated the timeline of key events and knowledge points that informs management’s determination to change the cost estimate related to regulatory requirements to achieve certification.\nTEXT: •We inquired of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which may affect total estimated costs to certify the aircraft.\nTEXT: •We obtained and evaluated communications with regulatory bodies for consistency between management’s certification timeline assumptions and cost estimates related to regulatory requirements.\nTEXT: •We tested the effectiveness of internal controls, including those over the data used in developing the cost estimates, the mathematical extrapolation of such data, and management’s judgment regarding the range of possible outcomes relating to the specific cost estimates in the current regulatory environment.\nTEXT: We have served as the Company's auditor since at least 1934; however, an earlier year could not be reliably determined.\nTITLE: REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTEXT: To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of The Boeing Company\nTITLE: Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
