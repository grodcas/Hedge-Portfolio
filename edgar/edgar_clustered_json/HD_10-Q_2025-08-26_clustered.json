Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to our receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at August 3, 2025 or February 2, 2025.\nTITLE: Supplier Finance Program\nTEXT: We have a supplier finance program whereby participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to receive payment for one or more of our payment obligations, prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from participating financial institutions. The payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program, and we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program, and we have not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program. Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program were $598 million at both August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025 and are recorded within accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: On July 4, 2025, the legislation commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (the “OBBBA”) was signed into law in the U.S., which includes a broad range of tax provisions, including the allowance to expense 100% of the cost of qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures. While we continue to assess its implications, we do not expect the provisions of the OBBBA to have a material impact to our estimated fiscal 2025 effective tax rate. We expect a reduction in our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments due to the above mentioned provisions.\nTEXT: In fiscal 2024, the Internal Revenue Service provided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states, extending the timeline to make certain tax payments. As a result, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment was deferred and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nTEXT: We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the six months ended August 3, 2025 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. There have been no significant changes in accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K, and those not discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTITLE: 2.SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\nTITLE: SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\n"

We are engaged in retail operations and sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, décor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products both in stores and online. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services, and tool and equipment rental. We currently conduct these operations in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents an operating segment. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three geographic operating segments into one reportable segment (the “Primary segment”) due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.\nTEXT: Other. As discussed in Note 10, in June 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor through its branches located throughout the U.S. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. We have determined that each of these three lines of business represents an operating segment, none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Topic 280 to be deemed a reportable segment. Therefore, results from our SRS operating segments are presented in “Other” beginning from the acquisition date of June 18, 2024.\nTEXT: Net sales presented in Other in the tables below relate to the sale of products by SRS, with roofing and related products accounting for approximately 62% and 63% of net sales in Other during the three and six months ended August 3, 2025, respectively, and approximately 65% during both the three and six months ended July 28, 2024.\nTEXT: Segment Information.

These backup credit facilities consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027, a 364-day $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2025.\nTEXT: In May 2025, we terminated all three back-up credit facility agreements and simultaneously entered into a new five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2030 and a new 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2026.\nTEXT: In July 2025, we increased our commercial paper program by $4.0 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of GMS (see Note 10). In July 2025, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we also entered into a new three-year $3.0 billion back-up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2028, a new 364-day $1.0 billion back-up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2026, and amended and restated our existing 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility to extend the maturity from May 2026 to July 2026.

At August 3, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities.

Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and to minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of certain senior notes.\nTEXT: We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at both August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025. These agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025, the fair values of these agreements totaled $599 million and $795 million, respectively, all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt. At August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025, the carrying amount of our long-term debt, excluding current installments, subject to fair value hedges was $14.5 billion and $14.3 billion, respectively.\nTEXT: During the three and six months ended August 3, 2025, there was no new material hedging activity or material change to any other hedging arrangement disclosed in our 2024 Form 10-K, and all related activity was immaterial for the periods presented within this report.\nTEXT: Collateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $530 million and $668 million as of August 3, 2025 and February 2, 2025, respectively, which was recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\nTEXT: •Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nTEXT: •Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nTEXT: •Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring management judgment to develop the Company’s own models with estimates and assumptions.\n"

In fiscal 2024, we recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. Measurement period adjustments recognized in fiscal 2025 were immaterial, and we finalized our purchase price allocation during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n"

For the first six months of fiscal 2025, net sales were $85.1 billion and net earnings were $8.0 billion, or $8.03 per diluted share.\nTEXT: During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, we opened three new stores in the U.S., resulting in a total store count of 2,353 at August 3, 2025. A total of 322 stores, or 13.7%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.6 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025, compared to 4.9 times at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by higher average inventory levels during the first six months of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: We generated $9.0 billion of cash flow from operations during the first six months of fiscal 2025. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $4.6 billion for dividends and fund $1.7 billion in capital expenditures. In addition, we repaid $1.2 billion of long-term debt and repaid $316 million of net commercial paper borrowings. In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.30 per share.\nTEXT: Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 27.2% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and 31.9% at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024.

In fiscal 2025, there is a one-week calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. For purposes of the following discussion, comparable sales, comparable customer transactions, and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 13-week period from fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Net Sales. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 were $45.3 billion, an increase of 4.9% from $43.2 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by SRS, which was acquired on June 18, 2024, and contributed $1.8 billion of incremental net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Net sales also increased due to the impact of a positive comparable sales environment and sales from new stores, partially offset by the calendar shift which resulted in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 including one less week of spring and one additional week of summer.\nTEXT: Online sales, which consist of sales of products generated through websites and mobile applications, represented 15.6% of net sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased by 10.1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Calculated on a comparable week basis relative to fiscal 2024, online sales increased by 11.5%.\nTEXT: A stronger U.S. dollar compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 negatively impacted net sales by $163 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Fiscal 2025 includes 52 weeks and fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks. For our calculation of comparable sales in fiscal 2025, we will compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2025 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2024. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTEXT: Total comparable sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 1.0%, primarily reflecting a 1.4% increase in comparable average ticket and a 0.4% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 40 basis points for the quarter. Our comparable sales results reflect broader customer engagement with smaller home improvement projects, which was offset by the continued impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring large home improvement project demand.\nTEXT: During the second quarter of fiscal 2025, our Storage & Organization, Bath, Hardware, Building Materials, Indoor Garden, Electrical, Kitchen & Blinds, Outdoor Garden, Millwork, Power, Plumbing, and Appliances merchandising departments within our Primary segment posted positive comparable sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Gross Profit\nTEXT: Gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 4.9% to $15.1 billion from $14.4 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for both the second quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024, and reflects benefits from shrink and supply chain efficiencies within our Primary segment in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results for the full second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Operating Expenses\nTEXT: Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nTEXT: Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $620 million, or 8.7%, to $7.8 billion from $7.1 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 17.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 16.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher payroll and related costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 within our Primary segment.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $68 million, or 9.2%, to $806 million from $738 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.7% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense related to SRS.\nTITLE: Interest and Other, net\nTEXT: Interest and other, net for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $61 million, or 12.5%, to $550 million from $489 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting higher long-term debt balances and lower interest income in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings during the second quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.2% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 24.5% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n"

In fiscal 2025, there is a one-week calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. For purposes of the following discussion, comparable sales, comparable customer transactions, and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 26-week period from fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Net Sales. Net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 were $85.1 billion, an increase of 7.0% from $79.6 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by SRS, which was acquired on June 18, 2024, and contributed $4.4 billion of incremental net sales during the first six months of fiscal 2025. Net sales also increased due to the impact of a positive comparable sales environment and sales from new stores. Additionally, due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, the first six months of fiscal 2025 included one less week of winter and one additional week of summer, which further contributed to the increase in net sales in the first six months of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: Online sales represented 15.6% of net sales during the first six months of fiscal 2025 and increased by 10.5% compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. Calculated on a comparable week basis relative to fiscal 2024, online sales increased by 10.0%.\nTEXT: A stronger U.S. dollar compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 negatively impacted net sales by $437 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: Comparable Sales. Total comparable sales for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 0.4%, reflecting a 0.7% increase in comparable average ticket and a 0.5% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 55 basis points for the first six months of fiscal 2025. Our comparable sales results reflect broader customer engagement with smaller home improvement projects, which was offset by the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring large home improvement project demand.\nTEXT: During the first six months of fiscal 2025, our Storage & Organization, Indoor Garden, Building Materials, Electrical, Outdoor Garden, Appliances, Plumbing, Bath, Hardware, and Kitchen & Blinds merchandising departments within our Primary segment posted positive comparable sales compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Gross Profit\nTEXT: Gross profit for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased 6.5% to $28.6 billion from $26.8 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.6% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 33.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit margin during the first six months of fiscal 2025 reflects the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results for the full first six months of fiscal 2025, partially offset by benefits from shrink and supply chain efficiencies within our Primary segment.\nTITLE: Operating Expenses\nTEXT: Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nTEXT: Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $1.5 billion, or 10.7%, to $15.3 billion from $13.8 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 18.0% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 17.4% for the first six months of fiscal 2024, which primarily reflects higher payroll and related costs during the first six months of fiscal 2025 along with the impact of a non-recurring legal-related benefit recognized during the first six months of fiscal 2024 within our Primary segment.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $177 million, or 12.4%, to $1.6 billion from $1.4 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.9% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and 1.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense related to SRS.\nTITLE: Interest and Other, net\nTEXT: Interest and other, net for the first six months of fiscal 2025 increased $224 million, or 24.4%, to $1.1 billion from $917 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.2% for the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher long-term debt balances and lower interest income in fiscal 2025, partially offset by lower commercial paper borrowings during fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 23.7% for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized during the first six months of fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Diluted Earnings per Share\nTEXT: Diluted earnings per share were $8.03 for the first six months of fiscal 2025, compared to $8.23 for the first six months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by lower net earnings during the first six months of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTEXT: To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\n"

ROIC is a non-GAAP profitability measure, not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity.

All other quarters include 13 weeks.\nTITLE: LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nTEXT: At August 3, 2025, we had $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, of which $1.1 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries. We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in connection with the acquisition of SRS and do not have plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: On July 4, 2025, the OBBBA was signed into law in the U.S., which includes a broad range of tax provisions, including the allowance to expense 100% of the cost of qualified property and immediate expensing of domestic research and experimental expenditures. While we continue to assess its implications, we expect a reduction in our fiscal 2025 cash tax payments due to the above mentioned provisions.\nTEXT: During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we invested approximately $1.7 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. In line with our expectation of approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2025 net sales, we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. We expect to make these investments across initiatives to improve the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities, to continue to mature and build out Pro customer capabilities, as well as to build new stores. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. We may also utilize strategic acquisitions to help accelerate our strategic initiatives.\nTEXT: In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.25 to $2.30 per share. During the first six months of fiscal 2025, we paid cash dividends of $4.6 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of August 3, 2025, approximately $11.7 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available.\n"

These back-up credit facilities consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027, a 364-day $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2025.\nTEXT: In May 2025, we terminated all three back-up credit facility agreements and simultaneously entered into a new five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2030 and a new 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2026.\nTEXT: In July 2025, we increased our commercial paper program by $4.0 billion in connection with the anticipated financing of the acquisition of GMS (see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements). In July 2025, in connection with the increase in the commercial paper program, we also entered into a new three-year $3.0 billion back-up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2028, a new 364-day $1.0 billion back-up credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2026, and amended and restated our existing 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility to extend the maturity from May 2026 to July 2026. In the aggregate, as of August 3, 2025, our commercial paper program allows for borrowings up to $11.0 billion and is supported by $11.0 billion of back-up credit facilities.\nTEXT: During the first six months of fiscal 2025, all of our short term borrowings were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding during that period was $1.1 billion. At August 3, 2025, we had no outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program or back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our back-up credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nTEXT: We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. We did not have any issuances of senior notes during the first six months of fiscal 2025. In April 2025, we repaid our $500 million 2.70% and $500 million 5.125% senior notes at maturity.\nTEXT: The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We were in compliance with all such covenants at August 3, 2025. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nTITLE: CASH FLOWS SUMMARY\nTITLE: Operating Activities\nTEXT: Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.9 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by increased inventory levels during the first six months of fiscal 2025 along with the deferral of our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment to the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Investing Activities\nTEXT: Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $17.2 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily resulting from cash paid to acquire SRS in fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Financing Activities\nTEXT: Net cash used in financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily reflected $4.6 billion of cash dividends paid, $1.2 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $316 million of net repayments of commercial paper borrowings. Net cash provided by financing activities in the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily reflected $10.0 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and $2.5 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments, which were used to finance the SRS acquisition. This was partially offset by $4.5 billion of cash dividends paid, $1.3 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $649 million of share repurchases prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nTEXT: During the first six months of fiscal 2025, there were no changes to our critical accounting estimates or our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTITLE: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTEXT: For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or may materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n"
