We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results.\nTITLE: 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies\nTEXT: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”.

This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. The guidance will require additional disclosures in the Segment Information footnote, but will not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”. This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\nTEXT: In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures: Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”.

The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was $78 and $83, respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, amortization expense was $241 and $255, respectively.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.\nTEXT: As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was impaired during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeds its carrying value by greater than 10%. As of March 31, 2025, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge.\nTEXT: The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\nTEXT: Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\nTEXT: The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\nTEXT: The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\nTEXT: We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2024, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value+25 bps Discount Rate-25 bps Growth Rates-50 bps Royalty RateGillette indefinite-lived intangible asset(5)%(5)%(4)%\n"

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements\nTEXT: As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2025.\nTEXT: The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the nine months ended March 31, 2025 or during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Cash equivalents were $7.9 billion and $8.0 billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented.\nTEXT: The fair value of long-term debt was $27.9 billion and $27.7 billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($4.7 billion and $3.8 billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively).

Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued liabilities of approximately $50, including interest and penalties.\nTEXT: Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n"

Supplier Finance Programs\nTEXT: The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.6 billion as of March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: 11. Restructuring Program\nTEXT: The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting.\nTEXT: In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company started a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. During the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed this limited market portfolio restructuring with the substantial liquidation of its operations in Argentina and recorded approximately $0.8 billion after tax of incremental charges, comprised primarily of non-cash charges for accumulated foreign currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The total incremental restructuring charges incurred under the program beginning in the three-month period ended December 31, 2023, through the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, were approximately $1.2 billion after tax.\nTEXT: For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company incurred total before tax charges of $55 including $23 in Costs of products sold, $26 in SG&A and $6 in Other non-operating income/(expense).

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes.\nTEXT: The MD&A is organized in the following sections:\nTEXT: •Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025\nTEXT: •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\nTEXT: •Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025\nTEXT: •Segment Results – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2025\nTEXT: •Liquidity and Capital Resources\nTEXT: •Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP\nTEXT: Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTEXT: Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market share through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales.

Net sales increased low single digits in Health Care, and decreased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty. Net sales in Grooming and Fabric & Home Care were unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 2%. Organic sales increased low single digits in Health Care, Grooming, Fabric & Home Care, Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care.\nTEXT: •Net earnings were $12.4 billion, an increase of $609 million, or 5%, versus the prior year period due to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year, partially offset by higher restructuring charges in the current year of $0.8 billion after tax related to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina.\nTEXT: •Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $12.4 billion, an increase of $617 million, or 5%, versus the prior year period.\nTEXT: •Diluted EPS increased 6% to $5.03 due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which excludes incremental restructuring charges and the prior year Gillette intangible asset impairment charge, increased 3% to $5.35.\nTEXT: •Operating cash flow was $12.8 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $10.6 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings excluding a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina, was 80%.\n"

Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to various risks due to economic, political and social instabilities, market volatility, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, new or increased tariffs (including any such tariffs between the U.S. and China or the U.S. and Canada), foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 and less than 2% of net assets as of June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 17\nTEXT: \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements, including tariffs, can also impact our financial performance.\nTEXT: For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\nTITLE: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2025\nTEXT: The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2025, versus the three months ended March 31, 2024.\nTEXT: Three Months Ended March 31Amounts in millions, except per share amounts20252024% ChgNet sales$19,776$20,195(2)%Operating income4,5584,4602%Earnings before income taxes4,6614,5922%Net earnings3,7933,781—%Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble3,7693,754—%Diluted net earnings per common share1.541.521%Core net earnings per common share1.541.521%Three Months Ended March 31COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES20252024Basis Pt ChgGross margin51.0 %51.2 %(20)Selling, general & administrative expense27.9 %29.1 %(120)Operating income23.0 %22.1 %90 Earnings before income taxes23.6 %22.7 %90 Net earnings19.2 %18.7 %50 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble19.1 %18.6 %50\nTABLE: TABLE: Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2025 2024 % Chg; Net sales $ 19,776 $ 20,195 (2)%; Operating income 4,558 4,460 2%; Earnings before income taxes 4,661 4,592 2%; Net earnings 3,793 3,781 —%; Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,769 3,754 —%; Diluted net earnings per common share 1.54 1.52 1%; Core net earnings per common share 1.54 1.52 1%; COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2025 2024 Basis Pt Chg; Gross margin 51.0 % 51.2 % (20); Selling, general & administrative expense 27.9 % 29.1 % (120); Operating income 23.0 % 22.1 % 90; Earnings before income taxes 23.6 % 22.7 % 90; Net earnings 19.2 % 18.7 % 50; Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.1 % 18.6 % 50.\nTITLE: Three Months Ended March 31\n"

SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 26.4% due primarily to a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were unchanged as wage inflation was offset by productivity savings, which includes adjustments to expected variable compensation payouts. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points primarily driven by favorable foreign exchange impacts. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales.\nTEXT: Operating income increased $1.4 billion, or 10%, to $16.1 billion and operating margin increased 230 basis points to 25.4% versus the prior year period due primarily to the non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset in the prior year.\nTITLE: Non-Operating Expenses and Income\nTEXT: Interest expense was $695 million for the period, a decrease of $10 million versus the prior year period. Interest income was $365 million for the period, a decrease of $1 million versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income/(expense) was $(120) million, which is a decrease of $690 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina recorded in the period ended September 30, 2024.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: The effective income tax rate for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, was 20.5%, compared to 20.6% for the nine months ended March 31, 2024. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation, favorable geographic mix impacts and decreases from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a 100 basis-point increase due primarily to the charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina.\nTEXT: 20 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTITLE: Net Earnings\nTEXT: Net earnings increased $609 million, or 5%, to $12.4 billion, as the increase in operating income, the components of which are described above, were partially offset by the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in Argentina recorded in the period ended September 30, 2024. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $58 million on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $617 million, or 5%, to $12.4 billion for the period. Diluted EPS increased 6% to $5.03 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings. Core EPS, which represents diluted EPS excluding charges for incremental restructuring and the impairment of the Gillette intangible asset, increased 3% to $5.35.\n"
