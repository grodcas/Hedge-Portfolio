The decrease reflected lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. Lower sales volume was primarily driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. Profit per share was $22.05 in 2024, compared with profit per share of $20.12 in 2023. Profit was $10.792 billion in 2024, compared with $10.335 billion in 2023. The profit impact of lower sales volume was more than offset by favorable price realization and the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023.\n"

Construction spend in North America remains healthy, primarily driven by large, multi-year projects and government-related infrastructure investments supported by funding from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). Although we anticipate the combined non-residential and residential construction spend in 2025 to remain similar to 2024 levels, our current planning assumptions reflect lower demand for new equipment in 2025 as compared to 2024. We also expect lower dealer rental fleet loading in 2025 compared to 2024, although dealer rental revenue is expected to grow. We remain positive about the medium- and long-term outlook in North America. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, we expect soft economic conditions to\nTEXT: continue into 2025. We anticipate China to remain at relatively low levels for the excavator industry above 10-tons. In EAME, we anticipate that weak economic conditions in Europe will continue, and we anticipate a healthy level of construction activity in Africa and in the Middle East in 2025. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to moderately decline in 2025 as compared to 2024. We also anticipate the ongoing benefit of our services initiatives will positively impact Construction Industries in 2025.\nTEXT: In Resource Industries, we anticipate lower sales of equipment to end users in 2025 compared to 2024, partially offset by higher services revenues, including robust rebuild activity. Customers continue to display capital discipline, although key commodities remain above investment thresholds. Customer product utilization remains high, the number of parked trucks remains relatively low, the age of the fleet remains elevated, and our autonomous solutions continue to see strong customer acceptance. We continue to believe the energy transition will support increased commodity demand over time, expanding our total addressable market and providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nTEXT: In Energy & Transportation, demand is expected to remain strong in Power Generation, as we expect growth for both reciprocating engines and turbines and turbine-related services in 2025 as compared to 2024. Overall strength in Power Generation, for both prime and backup power applications, continues to be driven by increasing energy demands to support data center growth related to cloud computing and generative artificial intelligence (AI). Through continued focus on improving manufacturing efficiencies, along with initial stages of our investment to increase large engine output capability, we expect growth in reciprocating engines for Power Generation in 2025. We also expect growth in turbines and turbine-related services for Power Generation, driven by increased customer demand. For Oil and Gas, we expect moderate growth in 2025 as compared to 2024. We expect reciprocating engines and services to be slightly down in 2025 due to continuing capital discipline by our customers, industry consolidation and efficiency improvements in our customers’ operations. We expect growth for turbines and turbine-related services in Oil & Gas in 2025 as compared to 2024. For turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil & Gas applications, backlog remains strong, and we see continued healthy order and inquiry activity. Demand for products in Industrial applications in 2025 is expected to remain at a relatively low level, similar to 2024. In Transportation, we anticipate growth in 2025, driven by rail services.\nTEXT: Full-Year 2025 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: For the full-year 2025, we anticipate sales and revenues will be slightly lower compared to 2024, primarily driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. We expect lower sales in Construction Industries and Resource Industries to be partially offset by higher sales in Energy & Transportation. Currently, we do not anticipate a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2025. Services revenues increased in 2024, and we expect services revenues to grow across all three primary segments in 2025.\nTEXT: For Construction Industries, we expect lower sales, including unfavorable price realization. In Resource Industries, we anticipate slightly lower sales, driven by unfavorable price realization and slightly lower sales volume. In Energy and Transportation, we expect an increase in sales driven by higher sales volume and favorable price realization.\nTEXT: In 2025, we anticipate unfavorable price realization and higher depreciation costs. We expect Other income (expense) to be unfavorable in 2025 as compared to 2024, primarily due to lower interest income as well as the absence of favorable foreign currency impacts. We do not anticipate translation movements in our expectations. In 2025, we expect restructuring costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million and expect capital expenditures of about $2.5 billion. We anticipate the annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be 23.0 percent in 2025.\nTEXT: First-Quarter 2025 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025, we expect lower sales and revenues as compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to the unfavorable impact from changes in machine dealer inventories and unfavorable machine price realization. We expect machine dealer inventory to increase less during the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the $1.1 billion increase in the first quarter of 2024.\n"

In 2025, we anticipate that trend to continue but be more pronounced as sales in the first quarter should account for a lower percentage of full year sales than is typical, mainly due to our expectations for changes in dealer inventories and price realization for machines. In Energy & Transportation, we expect normal seasonality with sales growing throughout the year.\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024, we anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries primarily due to lower sales of equipment to end users, an unfavorable impact from changes in dealer inventories and unfavorable price realization. In Resource Industries, we expect lower sales primarily due to lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization. In Energy & Transportation, we anticipate similar sales in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024, as continued strength in Power Generation is expected to be offset by lower sales in Oil & Gas and in Transportation. We expect favorable price realization for Energy & Transportation in the first quarter of 2025.\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025, we expect the profit impact from lower machine sales volume and unfavorable machine price realization to be partially offset by favorable price realization in Energy & Transportation. In Construction Industries and in Resource Industries, we expect an unfavorable profit impact from lower sales volume and unfavorable price realization in the first quarter of 2025 as compared to the first quarter of 2024. In Energy & Transportation, we expect unfavorable manufacturing costs and the impact of an unfavorable mix of products to be partially offset by favorable price realization.\nTEXT: We continue to monitor a variety of external factors around the world, such as supply chain disruptions, inflationary cost and labor pressures.

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company’s board of directors and employees.\nTEXT: Total sales and revenues for 2024 were $64.809 billion, a decrease of $2.251 billion, or 3 percent, compared with $67.060 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower sales volume of $3.543 billion, partially offset by favorable price realization of $1.238 billion. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users. In addition, changes in dealer inventories had an unfavorable impact to sales volume. Dealer inventory increased less during 2024 than during 2023.\nTEXT: In the three primary segments, sales were lower in Construction Industries and Resource Industries and higher in Energy & Transportation.\nTEXT: North America sales decreased 1 percent primarily due to lower sales volume, partially offset by favorable price realization.

The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by lower sales of equipment to end users.\nTEXT: Asia/Pacific sales decreased 6 percent primarily due to lower sales volume. The decrease in sales volume was mainly driven by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealer inventory decreased in 2024, compared to an increase in 2023.\nTEXT: Total dealer inventory increased about $400 million during 2024, compared to an increase of about $2.1 billion during 2023. Machine dealer inventory decreased about $700 million during 2024, compared to an increase of $700 million during 2023. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers’ demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers. We do not expect a significant change in machine dealer inventories in 2025.\nTEXT: Sales and Revenues by Segment(Millions of dollars)2023SalesVolumePriceRealizationCurrencyInter-Segment/Other2024$Change%ChangeConstruction Industries$27,418 $(1,737)$(70)$(143)$(13)$25,455 $(1,963)(7 %)Resource Industries13,583 (1,603)405 (28)32 12,389 (1,194)(9 %)Energy & Transportation28,001 (142)900 (25)120 28,854 853 3 %All Other Segment449 (17)5 (1)(11)425 (24)(5 %)Corporate Items and Eliminations(5,582)(44)(2)(4)(128)(5,760)(178) Machinery, Energy & Transportation63,869 (3,543)1,238 (201)— 61,363 (2,506)(4 %)Financial Products Segment3,785 — — — 268 4,053 268 7 %Corporate Items and Eliminations(594)— — — (13)(607)(13) Financial Products Revenues3,191 — — — 255 3,446 255 8 %Consolidated Sales and Revenues$67,060 $(3,543)$1,238 $(201)$255 $64,809 $(2,251)(3 %)\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2023 SalesVolume PriceRealization Currency Inter-Segment/Other 2024 $Change %Change; Construction Industries $ 27,418 $ (1,737) $ (70) $ (143) $ (13) $ 25,455 $ (1,963) (7 %); Resource Industries 13,583 (1,603) 405 (28) 32 12,389 (1,194) (9 %); Energy & Transportation 28,001 (142) 900 (25) 120 28,854 853 3 %; All Other Segment 449 (17) 5 (1) (11) 425 (24) (5 %); Corporate Items and Eliminations (5,582) (44) (2) (4) (128) (5,760) (178); Machinery, Energy & Transportation 63,869 (3,543) 1,238 (201) — 61,363 (2,506) (4 %); Financial Products Segment 3,785 — — — 268 4,053 268 7 %; Corporate Items and Eliminations (594) — — — (13) (607) (13); Financial Products Revenues 3,191 — — — 255 3,446 255 8 %; Consolidated Sales and Revenues $ 67,060 $ (3,543) $ 1,238 $ (201) $ 255 $ 64,809 $ (2,251) (3 %).\nTITLE: Sales and Revenues by Segment\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)2023SalesVolumePriceRealizationCurrencyInter-Segment/Other2024$Change%Change\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: SalesVolume\nTITLE: PriceRealization\nTITLE: Currency\nTITLE: Inter-Segment/Other\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: $Change\nTITLE: %Change\nTITLE: All Other Segment449 (17)5 (1)(11)425 (24)(5 %)\nTITLE: All Other Segment\nTITLE: Corporate Items and Eliminations(5,582)(44)(2)(4)(128)(5,760)(178)\nTITLE: Corporate Items and Eliminations\nTITLE: Machinery, Energy & Transportation63,869 (3,543)1,238 (201)— 61,363 (2,506)(4 %)\nTITLE: Machinery, Energy & Transportation\nTITLE: Financial Products Segment3,785 — — — 268 4,053 268 7 %\nTITLE: Financial Products Segment\nTITLE: Financial Products Revenues3,191 — — — 255 3,446 255 8 %\nTITLE: Financial Products Revenues\nTITLE: Consolidated Sales and Revenues$67,060 $(3,543)$1,238 $(201)$255 $64,809 $(2,251)(3 %)\n"

This was above the 1.15 to 1 minimum ratio, calculated as (1) profit excluding income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate derivatives to (2) interest expense calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter for the prior four consecutive fiscal quarter period, required by the Credit Facility.\nTEXT: In addition, at December 31, 2024, Cat Financial’s six-month covenant leverage ratio was 7.25 to 1 and year-end covenant leverage ratio was 7.37 to 1. This was below the maximum ratio of debt to net worth of 10 to 1, calculated (1) on a monthly basis as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December 31, required by the Credit Facility.\nTEXT: In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial's other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings. At December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nTEXT: The aforementioned financial covenants are being reported as calculated under the Credit Facility and not pursuant to U.S. GAAP.

These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.\nTEXT: We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies. Fitch maintains a \"high-A\" debt rating, while Moody’s and S&P maintain a “mid-A” debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&T’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar. In addition, we maintain a support agreement with Cat Financial, which requires Caterpillar to remain the sole owner of Cat Financial and may, under certain circumstances, require Caterpillar to make payments to Cat Financial should Cat Financial fail to maintain certain financial ratios.\nTEXT: We facilitate voluntary supplier finance programs (the “Programs”) through participating financial institutions. We account for the payments made under the Programs, the same as our other accounts payable, as a reduction to our cash flows from operations. We do not believe that changes in the availability of the Programs will have a significant impact on our liquidity. Additional information related to the Programs is included in Note 19 — \"Supplier finance programs\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\".\nTITLE: Material cash requirements for contractual obligations\nTEXT: We believe our balances of cash and cash equivalents of $6.89 billion and available-for-sale debt securities of $1.98 billion as of December 31, 2024, along with cash generated by ongoing operations and continued access to debt markets, will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\nTEXT: We have committed cash outflows related to postretirement benefit obligations, long-term debt and operating lease agreements. See Notes 12, 14 and 20, respectively, of Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for additional information.\nTEXT: We have short-term obligations related to the purchase of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business. These consist of invoices received and recorded as liabilities as of December 31, 2024, but scheduled for payment in 2025 of $7.68 billion. In addition, we have contractual obligations for material and services on order at December 31, 2024, but not yet invoiced or delivered, of $6.69 billion.\nTEXT: We also have long-term contractual obligations primarily for logistics services agreements; systems support, software licenses and development contracts; information technology consulting contracts; outsourcing contracts for benefit plan administration and long-term commitments entered into with key suppliers for minimum purchase quantities. These obligations total $1.63 billion, with $762 million due in the next 12 months.\n"

The decrease was primarily due to changes in accrued wages, salaries, and employee benefits, higher cash taxes paid, and changes in other liabilities. These were partially offset by decreased working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in receivables, accounts payable, and customer advances favorably impacted cash flow partially offset by changes in accrued expenses.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by investing activities in 2024 was $133 million, compared with net cash used of $3.92 billion in 2023. The change was due to lower new investments in securities and higher proceeds from maturities and sale of securities, primarily due to time deposit maturities in 2024.\nTEXT: Net cash used for financing activities during 2024 was $11.42 billion, compared with $7.65 billion in 2023. The change was primarily due to higher payments to repurchase shares and debt repayments in 2024.\nTEXT: While our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational requirements and commitments. Then, we intend to fund priorities that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional information on cash deployment is as follows:\nTEXT: Strong financial position — Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.\nTEXT: Operational excellence and commitments — Capital expenditures were $1.99 billion during 2024, compared to $1.66 billion in 2023. We expect ME&T’s capital expenditures in 2025 to be about $2.5 billion. We made $271 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans during 2024. In comparison, we made $361 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2023. We expect to make approximately $354 million of contributions to our pension and OPEB plans in 2025.\nTEXT: Fund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders — We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings, services and sustainability, including acquisitions.\nTEXT: As part of our capital allocation strategy, ME&T free cash flow is a liquidity measure we use to determine the cash generated and available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We define ME&T free cash flow as cash from ME&T operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.\nTEXT: Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company's dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In December 2024, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.41 per share, and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend. Dividends paid totaled $2.65 billion in 2024.\nTEXT: Our share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis considering the financial condition of the company, corporate cash flow, the company's liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets. The timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and investing priorities. In May 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase authorization (the 2022 Authorization) of up to $15.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock effective August 1, 2022 with no expiration. In June 2024, the Board approved an additional share repurchase authorization (the 2024 Authorization) of up to $20.0 billion of Caterpillar common stock, effective June 12, 2024, with no expiration. In 2024, we repurchased $7.7 billion of Caterpillar common stock, with $20.1 billion remaining under the 2022 and 2024 Authorizations as of December 31, 2024. Caterpillar's basic shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024 were approximately 478 million.\nTITLE: Financial Products\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.45 billion in 2024, compared with $1.11 billion in 2023. Net cash used for investing activities was $2.79 billion in 2024, compared with $1.42 billion used in 2023. The change was primarily due to portfolio related activity and the divestiture of a non-U.S. entity. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.21 billion in 2024, compared with net cash provided of $278 million in 2023. The change was primarily due to higher net inflows from external borrowings partially offset by higher dividends paid to Caterpillar in 2024.\nTITLE: Off-balance sheet arrangements\nTEXT: We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, primarily in the form of guarantees.

The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have incorporated many years of data into the determination of each of these estimates and we have not historically experienced significant adjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the methods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and an indication of the risks inherent in each.\nTEXT: Residual values for leased assets — We determine the residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant\nTEXT: market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\nTEXT: Upon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third-party, in which case we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale proceeds.\nTEXT: During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\nTEXT: We evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases for potential impairment when we determine a triggering event has occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test for recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment, we measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases in accordance with the fair value measurement framework. We recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its estimated fair value.\nTEXT: At December 31, 2024, the aggregate residual value of equipment on operating leases was $1.55 billion. Without consideration of other factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual customer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease in the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases would reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition of approximately $70 million of additional annual depreciation expense.\nTEXT: Fair values for goodwill impairment tests — We test goodwill for impairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse change in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion of a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\nTEXT: We review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.\nTEXT: For reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow with a year-five residual value. We compute the residual value using the constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash flows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast and are subject to review and approval by senior management. A reporting unit’s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a market participant’s perspective. The estimated fair value could be impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates, growth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. We categorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs.\nTEXT: We completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2024 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. Caterpillar's market capitalization has remained significantly above the net book value of the Company.\n"

The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly cyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although the impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining industries are major users of our products, including the mineral extraction, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our products are dependent upon the performance of those industries, which in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower commodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have a negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the fair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and it becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value has fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim goodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment test. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment, depending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test. We would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to earnings.\nTEXT: Product warranty liability — At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. We determine the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from those estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our historical rates.\nTEXT: Product liability and insurance loss reserve — We determine these reserves based upon reported claims in process of settlement and actuarial estimates for losses incurred but not reported. Loss reserves, including incurred but not reported reserves, are based on estimates, and ultimate settlements may vary significantly from such estimates due to increased claims frequency or severity over historical levels. The amount of these reserves totaled $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance in both 2024 and 2023 consisted of unearned insurance premiums.\nTEXT: Postretirement benefits — We sponsor defined benefit pension plans and/or other postretirement benefit plans (retirement healthcare and life insurance) to employees in many of our locations throughout the world. There are assumptions used in the accounting for these defined benefit plans that include discount rate, expected return on plan assets, expected rate of compensation increase, the future health care trend rate, mortality and other economic and demographic assumptions. The actuarial assumptions we use may change or differ significantly from actual results, which may result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: The effects of actual results differing from our assumptions and the effects of changing assumptions are considered actuarial gains or losses. We utilize a mark-to-market approach in recognizing actuarial gains or losses immediately through earnings upon the annual remeasurement in the fourth quarter, or on an interim basis as triggering events warrant remeasurement.\nTEXT: Primary actuarial assumptions were determined as follows:\nTEXT: •We use the assumed discount rate to discount future benefit obligations back to today’s dollars. The U.S. discount rate is based on a benefit cash flow-matching approach and represents the rate at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled as of our measurement date, December 31. The benefit cash flow-matching approach involves analyzing Caterpillar’s projected cash flows against a high quality bond yield curve, calculated using a wide population of corporate Aa bonds available on the measurement date. We use a similar approach to determine the assumed discount rate for our most significant non-U.S. plans. In estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost, we utilize a full yield curve approach in determining a discount rate. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Discount rates are sensitive to changes in interest rates.\nTEXT: •The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on our estimate of long-term returns for equities and fixed income securities weighted by the allocation of our plan assets. This rate is impacted by changes in general market conditions, but because it represents a long-term rate, it is not significantly impacted by short-term market swings. Changes in our allocation of plan assets would also impact this rate. For example, a shift to more fixed income securities would lower the rate. The expected return on plan assets is based on the fair value of plan asset allocations as of our measurement date, December 31.\nTEXT: •We use the expected rate of compensation increase to develop benefit obligations using projected pay at retirement. It represents average long-term salary increases. This rate is influenced by our long-term compensation policies.\nTEXT: •The assumed health care trend rate represents the rate at which health care costs are assumed to increase and is based on historical and expected experience. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care (e.g., technology driven cost changes) will impact this trend rate.\nTEXT: •We use the mortality assumption to estimate the life expectancy of plan participants.\n"

We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. The amount of accrued post-sale discounts was $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The reserve represents discounts that we expect to pay on previously sold units and is reviewed at least quarterly. We adjust the reserve if discounts paid differ from those estimated. Historically, those adjustments have not been material.\nTEXT: Allowance for credit losses — The allowance for credit losses is management’s estimate of expected losses over the life of our finance receivable portfolio calculated using loss forecast models that take into consideration historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions and forecasts and scenarios that capture country and industry-specific economic factors. In addition, we consider qualitative factors not able to be fully captured in our loss forecast models, including borrower-specific and company-specific factors. These qualitative factors are subjective and require a degree of management judgment.\nTEXT: We measure the allowance for credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we determine that similar risk characteristics do not exist. We identify finance receivables for individual evaluation based on past due status and information available about the customer, such as financial statements, news reports and published credit ratings, as well as general information regarding industry trends and the economic environment in which our customers operate. The allowance for credit losses attributable to finance receivables that are individually evaluated is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables' effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, we estimate the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. We also consider credit enhancements such as additional collateral and contractual third-party guarantees.\nTEXT: While management believes it has exercised prudent judgment and applied reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that in the future, changes in economic conditions or other factors would not cause changes in the financial health of our customers. If the financial health of our customers deteriorates, the timing and level of payments received could be impacted and therefore, could result in a change to our estimated losses.\nTEXT: Income taxes — We are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate. These tax laws are complex, and the manner in which they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. In establishing the provision for income taxes, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax laws. Our income tax positions and analysis are based on currently enacted tax law. Future changes in tax law or related interpretations could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. Changes in tax law are reflected in the period of enactment with related interpretations considered in the period received.\nTEXT: Despite our belief that our tax return positions are consistent with applicable tax laws, we believe that taxing authorities could challenge certain positions. Settlement of any challenge can result in no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We record tax benefits for uncertain tax positions based upon management’s evaluation of the information available at the reporting date. To be recognized in the financial statements, a tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on technical merits. The benefit for positions meeting the recognition threshold is measured as the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required in making these determinations and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits may be necessary to reflect actual taxes payable upon settlement. Adjustments related to positions impacting the effective tax rate affect the provision for income taxes. Adjustments related to positions impacting the timing of deductions impact deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n"

Certain estimates and assumptions are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

This expected decrease is primarily due to lower interest cost in 2025 as a result of higher discount rates at the end of 2024 creating a lower obligation base (U.S. pension plans year-end 2024 obligation was $12.2 billion compared to a year-end 2023 obligation of $13.1 billion) and a higher expected return on assets in 2025 (U.S. pension plans expected rate of return on plans assets is 6.3 percent for 2025 compared to 5.7 percent for 2024; however, this increase is muted due to a lower asset base at year-end 2024 of $11.9 billion compared to $12.7 billion at year-end 2023).\nTEXT: •Decrease in expense in 2024 compared to 2023 — Primarily due to higher mark-to-market gains in 2024 compared to 2023, lower interest cost in 2024 as a result of lower discount rates at year-end 2023 and a higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher asset base at year-end 2023 compared to year-end 2022.\nTEXT: •Increase in expense in 2023 compared to 2022 — Primarily due to lower mark-to-market gains in 2023 compared to 2022 and higher interest cost in 2023 as a result of higher discount rates at year-end 2022.\nTEXT: The primary factors that resulted in mark-to-market losses (gains) for 2024, 2023 and 2022 are described below.

Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. Based on the anticipated and firmly committed cash inflow and outflow for our ME&T operations for the next 12 months and the foreign currency derivative instruments in place at year-end, a hypothetical 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would adversely affect our expected 2025 cash flow for our ME&T operations by approximately $77 million. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a potential $200 million adverse impact on 2024 cash flow. We determine our net exposures by calculating the difference in cash inflow and outflow by currency and adding or subtracting outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments. We multiply these net amounts by 10 percent to determine the sensitivity.\nTEXT: In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Since our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies, a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other currencies would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Neither our policy nor the effect of a 10 percent change in the value of the U.S. dollar has changed from that reported at the end of last year.\nTEXT: The effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables, including competitive risk. If it were possible to quantify this competitive impact, the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above. In addition, it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the U.S. dollar. In reality, some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen. Our primary exposure (excluding competitive risk) is to exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Indian rupee and Mexican peso.\n"

A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would have a minimal impact to the 2025 pre-tax earnings of ME&T. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2024 pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: For our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative instruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and strategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the finance receivable portfolio. Match funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: In order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates, Financial Products measures the potential impact of different interest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet positions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in the analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are that there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion of fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the level of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis of the December 31, 2024 balance sheet, using these assumptions, estimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained adverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2025 pre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2024 pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: This analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook of future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any actions management could undertake in response to changes in interest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual results would be consistent with the results of our estimate.\n"

We believe the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business results and trends and aids with assessing the company's period-over-period results.\nTEXT: A reconciliation of our effective tax rate to annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items is below:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)Profit Before TaxesProvision (Benefit) for Income TaxesEffective Tax RateTwelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$13,373 $2,629 19.7 %Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities164 54 Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses(154)(43)Tax law change related to currency translation— 224 Changes in estimates related to prior years— 47 Excess stock-based compensation— 57 Annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items$13,383 $2,968 22.2 %Changes in estimates related to prior years— (47)Excess stock-based compensation— (57)Other restructuring (income) costs195 46 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted$13,578 $2,910\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Profit Before Taxes Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes Effective Tax Rate; Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP $ 13,373 $ 2,629 19.7 %; Restructuring (income) costs - divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities 164 54; Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses (154) (43); Tax law change related to currency translation — 224; Changes in estimates related to prior years — 47; Excess stock-based compensation — 57; Annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items $ 13,383 $ 2,968 22.2 %; Changes in estimates related to prior years — (47); Excess stock-based compensation — (57); Other restructuring (income) costs 195 46; Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - Adjusted $ 13,578 $ 2,910.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Profit Before TaxesProvision (Benefit) for Income TaxesEffective Tax Rate\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Profit Before Taxes\nTITLE: Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nTITLE: Effective Tax Rate\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP$13,373 $2,629 19.7 %\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2024 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 13,373\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,629\nTITLE: 19.7\nTITLE: %\nTEXT: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$13,050 $2,781 21.3 %Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture586 — Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses(97)(26)Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments— 88 Excess stock-based compensation— 57 Annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items$13,539 $2,900 21.4 %Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments— 18 Excess stock-based compensation— (57)Other restructuring (income) costs194 48 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted$13,733 $2,909\nTABLE: TABLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP $ 13,050 $ 2,781 21.3 %; Restructuring costs - Longwall divestiture 586 —; Pension/OPEB mark-to-market (gains) losses (97) (26); Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments — 88; Excess stock-based compensation — 57; Annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items $ 13,539 $ 2,900 21.4 %; Deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments — 18; Excess stock-based compensation — (57); Other restructuring (income) costs 194 48; Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - Adjusted $ 13,733 $ 2,909.\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP$13,050 $2,781 21.3 %\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2023 - U.S. GAAP\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 13,050\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,781\nTITLE: 21.3\nTITLE: %\nTEXT: In addition, we provide a calculation of ME&T free cash flow as we believe it is an important measure for investors to determine the cash generation available for financing activities including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.\nTEXT: Reconciliations of ME&T free cash flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, net cash provided by operating activities are as follows:\nTEXT: Millions of dollarsTwelve Months Ended December 31,20242023ME&T net cash provided by operating activities 1$11,437 $11,688 ME&T capital expenditures(1,988)(1,663)ME&T free cash flow$9,449 $10,025 1 See reconciliation of ME&T net cash provided by operating activities to consolidated net cash provided by operating activities on page 52.\nTABLE: TABLE: Millions of dollars Twelve Months Ended December 31,; 2024 2023; ME&T net cash provided by operating activities 1 $ 11,437 $ 11,688; ME&T capital expenditures (1,988) (1,663); ME&T free cash flow $ 9,449 $ 10,025.\nTITLE: Millions of dollarsTwelve Months Ended December 31,\nTITLE: Millions of dollars\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended December 31,\nTITLE: 20242023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: ME&T net cash provided by operating activities 1$11,437 $11,688\nTEXT: ME&T net cash provided by operating activities 1\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 11,437\nTITLE: ME&T capital expenditures(1,988)(1,663)\nTITLE: (1,988)\nTITLE: ME&T free cash flow$9,449 $10,025\nTITLE: $\n"

(company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nTEXT: Management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment we concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nTEXT: The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm. Their report appears on pages 55- 56.\nTEXT: /s/ D. James Umpleby III D. James Umpleby III Chief Executive Officer /s/ Andrew R.J. Bonfield Andrew R.J.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nTEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nTEXT: Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nTITLE: Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n"

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTEXT: As described in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s product warranty liability as of December 31, 2024 was $1,700 million. At the time the Company recognizes a sale, management records estimated future warranty costs. Management determines the product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, management bases historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). Management develops specific rates for each product shipment month and updates them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\nTEXT: The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the product warranty liability is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the estimate of the product warranty liability, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumption related to historical claim rates, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nTEXT: Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s estimate of the product warranty liability. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data provided by management and (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of management’s estimate by performing one or a combination of procedures, including (a) developing an independent actuarial estimate of the product warranty liability, and comparing the independent estimate to management’s actuarial determined liability; and (b) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial methodologies and the reasonableness of management’s significant assumption related to historical claim rates.\nTEXT: We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1925.\nTEXT: STATEMENT 1Caterpillar Inc.Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31,(Dollars in millions except per share data) 202420232022Sales and revenues: Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation$61,363 $63,869 $56,574 Revenues of Financial Products3,446 3,191 2,853 Total sales and revenues64,809 67,060 59,427 Operating costs: Cost of goods sold40,199 42,767 41,350 Selling, general and administrative expenses6,667 6,371 5,651 Research and development expenses2,107 2,108 1,814 Interest expense of Financial Products1,286 1,030 565 Goodwill impairment charge— — 925 Other operating (income) expenses1,478 1,818 1,218 Total operating costs51,737 54,094 51,523 Operating profit13,072 12,966 7,904 Interest expense excluding Financial Products512 511 443 Other income (expense)813 595 1,291 Consolidated profit before taxes13,373 13,050 8,752 Provision (benefit) for income taxes2,629 2,781 2,067 Profit of consolidated companies10,744 10,269 6,685 Equity in profit (loss) of unconsolidated affiliated companies44 63 19 Profit of consolidated and affiliated companies10,788 10,332 6,704 Less: Profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(4)(3)(1)Profit 1 $10,792 $10,335 $6,705 Profit per common share$22.17 $20.24 $12.72 Profit per common share — diluted 2$22.05 $20.12 $12.64 Weighted-average common shares outstanding (millions) - Basic486.7 510.6 526.9 - Diluted 2489.4 513.6 530.4\nTABLE: TABLE: STATEMENT 1 Caterpillar Inc.; 2024 2023 2022; Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation $ 61,363 $ 63,869 $ 56,574; Revenues of Financial Products 3,446 3,191 2,853; Total sales and revenues 64,809 67,060 59,427; Cost of goods sold 40,199 42,767 41,350; Selling, general and administrative expenses 6,667 6,371 5,651; Research and development expenses 2,107 2,108 1,814; Interest expense of Financial Products 1,286 1,030 565; Goodwill impairment charge — — 925; Other operating (income) expenses 1,478 1,818 1,218; Total operating costs 51,737 54,094 51,523; Operating profit 13,072 12,966 7,904; Interest expense excluding Financial Products 512 511 443; Other income (expense) 813 595 1,291; Consolidated profit before taxes 13,373 13,050 8,752; Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,629 2,781 2,067; Profit of consolidated companies 10,744 10,269 6,685; Equity in profit (loss) of unconsolidated affiliated companies 44 63 19; Profit of consolidated and affiliated companies 10,788 10,332 6,704; Less: Profit (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (4) (3) (1); Profit 1 $ 10,792 $ 10,335 $ 6,705; Profit per common share $ 22.17 $ 20.24 $ 12.72; Profit per common share — diluted 2 $ 22.05 $ 20.12 $ 12.64; - Basic 486.7 510.6 526.9; - Diluted 2 489.4 513.6 530.4.\nTITLE: STATEMENT 1Caterpillar Inc.\nTITLE: STATEMENT 1\nTITLE: Caterpillar Inc.\nTITLE: Consolidated Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31,\n"

Nature of operations\nTEXT: Information in our financial statements and related commentary are presented in the following categories:\nTEXT: Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) – We define ME&T as Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries, excluding Financial Products. ME&T's information relates to the design, manufacturing and marketing of our products.\nTEXT: Financial Products – We define Financial Products as our finance and insurance subsidiaries, primarily Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation (Cat Financial) and Caterpillar Insurance Holdings Inc. (Insurance Services). Financial Products’ information relates to the financing to customers and dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other equipment.\nTEXT: We sell our products primarily under the brands “Caterpillar,” “CAT,” design versions of “CAT” and “Caterpillar,” “EMD,” “FG Wilson,” “MWM,” “Perkins,” “Progress Rail,” “SEM” and “Solar Turbines.”\nTEXT: We conduct operations in our ME&T line of business under highly competitive conditions, including intense price competition. We place great emphasis on the high quality and performance of our products and our dealers’ service support. Although no one competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of equipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and small, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\nTEXT: We distribute our machines principally through a worldwide organization of dealers (dealer network), 41 located in the United States and 111 located outside the United States, serving 187 countries. We sell reciprocating engines principally through the dealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products. We also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our subsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide network of 88 distributors covering 185 countries. We sell the FG Wilson branded electric power generation systems through its worldwide network of 108 distributors covering 158 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with our products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our products are the dealers’ principal business. We sell some products, primarily turbines and locomotives, to end customers through sales forces employed by the company. At times, these employees are assisted by independent sales representatives.\nTEXT: The Financial Products line of business also conducts operations under highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of Caterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies. We offer various financing, insurance and risk management products designed to support sales of our products and generate financing income for our company. We conduct a significant portion of Financial Products activity in North America, with additional offices in Latin America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Africa.\nTITLE: B. Basis of presentation\nTEXT: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Caterpillar Inc. and its subsidiaries where we have a controlling financial interest.\nTEXT: Investments in companies where our ownership exceeds 20 percent and we do not have a controlling interest or where the ownership is less than 20 percent and for which we have a significant influence are accounted for by the equity method.\nTEXT: We consolidate all variable interest entities (VIEs) where Caterpillar Inc. is the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further discussion on a consolidated VIE.\nTEXT: Cat Financial has end-user customers and dealers that are VIEs of which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to loss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit risk inherently present in the financial support that we have provided. Credit risk was evaluated and reflected in our financial statements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables and related allowance for credit losses.\nTEXT: We include shipping and handling costs in Cost of goods sold in Statement 1. Other operating (income) expenses primarily include Cat Financial’s depreciation on equipment leased to others, Insurance Services’ underwriting expenses, (gains) losses on divestitures, employee separation charges, (gains) losses on disposal of long-lived assets and long-lived asset impairment charges.\nTEXT: Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 primarily include investments in debt and equity securities, prepaid and refundable income taxes, right of return assets, prepaid insurance, contract assets, assets held for sale, core to be returned for remanufacturing, and restricted cash and other short-term investments.\nTEXT: Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform with the current-year financial statement presentation.\nTITLE: C. Inventories\nTEXT: We state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We principally determine cost using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. The value of inventories on the LIFO basis represented about 65 percent of total inventories at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTEXT: If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method had been in use, inventories would have been $3,864 million and $3,423 million higher than reported at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n"

Depreciation and amortization\nTEXT: We compute depreciation of plant and equipment principally using accelerated methods. We compute depreciation on equipment leased to others, primarily for Financial Products, using the straight-line method over the term of the lease. The depreciable basis is the original cost of the equipment less the estimated residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, Cat Financial depreciation on equipment leased to others was $722 million, $713 million and $718 million, respectively, which we include in Other operating (income) expenses in Statement 1. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, consolidated depreciation expense was $1,983 million, $1,929 million and $1,937 million, respectively. We compute amortization of purchased finite-lived intangibles principally using the straight-line method, generally not to exceed a period of 20 years.\nTITLE: E. Foreign currency translation\nTEXT: The functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of our Financial Products consolidated subsidiaries is the respective local currency. We include gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional currency in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. We include gains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities from the functional currency to U.S. dollars in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in Statement 3.\nTITLE: F. Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and certain deferred compensation plan liabilities. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, commodity price and certain deferred compensation plan liability exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity forward and option contracts and total return swap contracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 4 for more information.\nTITLE: G. Income taxes\nTEXT: We determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and liability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain tax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. We recognize a current liability for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. We adjust deferred taxes for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See Note 6 for further discussion.\nTITLE: H. Goodwill\nTEXT: For acquisitions accounted for as a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill for impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially recorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our integration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the acquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company, the businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or integrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in the composition of our operating segments or reporting units, we reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on their relative fair values.\nTEXT: We perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis. We review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income approach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we would recognize the difference as an impairment loss. See Note 10 for further details.\nTITLE: I. Estimates in financial statements\nTEXT: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair values for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability and reserves for product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes.\nTITLE: J.

Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation\nTEXT: We recognize sales of ME&T when all the following criteria are satisfied: (i) a contract with an independently owned and operated dealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii) it is probable we will collect the amount charged to the dealer or end user; and (iii) we have completed our performance obligation whereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product. A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership transfer when we ship the product. Products that are exported from a country for sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership at the border of the destination country.\nTEXT: Our remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related products. In this business, we inspect, clean and remanufacture used engines and related components (core). In connection with the sale of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified time period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they are returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product to dealers and end users. We recognize revenue pursuant to the same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above. At the time of sale, we recognize the deposit in Other current liabilities in Statement 3, and we recognize the core to be returned as an asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3 at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience with usable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay the deposit and relieve the liability. We then transfer the returned core asset into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.\nTEXT: We provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs. We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of our products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. Generally, we estimate the cost of these discounts for each product by model by geographic region based on historical experience and known changes in merchandising programs. We report the cost of these discounts as a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the product sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on units sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, we report the difference as a change in the transaction price.\nTEXT: Except for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale of our products. We estimate replacement part returns based on historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned. We also recognize a refund liability in Accrued expenses in Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts. If actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated, we recognize the difference in the estimated replacement part return asset and refund liability in Cost of goods sold and Sales, respectively.\nTEXT: Trade receivables represent amounts due from dealers and end users for the sale of our products, and include amounts due from wholesale inventory financing provided by Cat Financial for a dealer's purchase of inventory. See Note 7 for further information. We recognize trade receivables from dealers and end users in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade and other in Statement 3. Trade receivables from dealers and end users were $7,864 million, $7,923 million and $7,551 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Long-term trade receivables from dealers and end users were $640 million, $589 million and $506 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTEXT: Our standard dealer invoice terms are established by marketing region. Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the responsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly after the time of sale. When we make a sale to a\nTEXT: dealer, the dealer is responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an end user. Dealers and end users must make payment within the established invoice terms to avoid potential interest costs. Interest at or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due balance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. Regular credit evaluations of our dealers and end users are performed. Collateral generally is not required, and the majority of our trade receivables are unsecured. Various devices, such as security agreements and letters of credit, are used to protect our interests, when deemed necessary. No single dealer or end user represents a significant concentration of credit risk. Our allowance for credit losses is not significant for ME&T receivables.\n"

We recognize a contract asset when a sale is recognized before achieving the contractual milestone for invoicing. We reduce the contract asset when we invoice for payment and recognize a corresponding trade receivable. Contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3. Contract assets were $238 million, $246 million and $247 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTEXT: We invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products. We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract liability in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3. Contract liabilities were $2,745 million, $2,389 million and $2,314 million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We reduce the contract liability when we recognize revenue. During 2024, we recognized $1,591 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2024. During 2023, we recognized $1,660 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of 2023.\nTEXT: We have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of revenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user for the effects of time value of money when the timing difference between receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less than one year.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2024, we have entered into contracts with dealers and end users for which sales have not been recognized as we have not satisfied our performance obligations and transferred control of the products. The dollar amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year is $15.2 billion, with about one-half of the amount expected to be completed and revenue recognized in the twelve months following December 31, 2024. We have elected the practical expedient to not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations with an original contract duration of one year or less. Contracts with an original duration of one year or less are primarily sales to dealers for machinery, engines and replacement parts.\nTEXT: We exclude sales and other related taxes from the transaction price. We account for shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred as a fulfillment cost which is included in Cost of goods sold.\nTEXT: We provide a standard manufacturer’s warranty of our products at no additional cost. At the time we recognize a sale, we record estimated future warranty costs. See Note 21 for further discussion of our product warranty liabilities.\nTEXT: See Note 23 for further disaggregated sales and revenues information.\nTITLE: B. Revenues of Financial Products\nTEXT: Revenues of Financial Products are generated primarily from finance revenue on finance receivables and rental payments on operating leases. We record finance revenue over the life of the related finance receivables using the interest method, including the accretion of certain direct origination costs that are deferred. Operating lease revenue is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nTEXT: We suspend recognition of finance revenue and operating lease revenue and place the account on non-accrual status when management determines that collection of future income is not probable (generally after 120 days past due). We resume recognition of revenue, and recognize previously suspended income, when we consider collection of remaining amounts to be probable. Payments received while the finance receivable is on non-accrual status are applied to interest and principal in accordance with the contractual terms. We write off interest earned but uncollected prior to the receivables being placed on non-accrual status through Provision for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, we consider it to be uncollectible. See Note 7 for more information.\n"

Stock-based compensation\nTEXT: Our stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the granting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and other key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock options permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock’s price when the option was granted. RSUs are agreements to issue shares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting. PRSUs are similar to RSUs and include performance conditions in the vesting terms of the award.\nTEXT: Our long-standing practices and policies specify that the Compensation Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors approve all stock-based compensation awards. The award approval process specifies the grant date, value and terms of the award. We consistently apply the same terms and conditions to all employee grants, including Officers. The Committee approves all individual Officer grants. We determine the number of stock-based compensation award units included in an individual’s award based on the methodology approved by the Committee. The exercise price methodology approved by the Committee is the closing price of the Company stock on the date of the grant. In June of 2014, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2014 Plan) under which all new stock-based compensation awards were granted. In June of 2023, shareholders approved the Caterpillar Inc. 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2023 Plan), which superseded and replaced the 2014 Plan.\nTEXT: Common stock issued from Treasury stock under the plans totaled 1,972,037 for 2024, 2,497,799 for 2023 and 2,340,887 for 2022. The total number of shares authorized for equity awards under the 2023 Plan is 42,500,000. As of December 31, 2024, 40,873,176 shares remained available for issuance, which includes shares returned to the 2023 Plan upon cancellation or shares withheld for taxes incurred in connection with issuance or vesting of grants made under the 2014 Plan.\nTEXT: Stock option and RSU awards generally vest according to a three-year graded vesting schedule. One-third of the award will become vested on the first anniversary of the grant date, one-third of the award will become vested on the second anniversary of the grant date and one-third of the award will become vested on the third anniversary of the grant date. PRSU awards generally have a three-year performance period and cliff vest at the end of the period based upon achievement of performance targets established at the time of grant.\nTEXT: Upon separation from service, if the participant is 55 years of age or older with more than five years of service, the participant meets the criteria for a “Long Service Separation.” Award terms for stock option and RSU grants allow for continued vesting as of each vesting date specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. We recognize compensation expense for eligible employees for the grants over the period from the grant date to the end date of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, we recognized compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\nTEXT: Award terms for PRSU grants allow for continued vesting upon achievement of the performance target specified in the award document for employees who meet the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” and fulfill a requisite service period of six months. We recognize compensation expense for the PRSU grants with respect to employees who have met the criteria for a “Long Service Separation” over the period from the grant date to the end of the six-month requisite service period. For employees who become eligible for a “Long Service Separation” subsequent to the end date of the six-month requisite service period and prior to the completion of the vesting period, we recognize compensation expense over the period from the grant date to the date eligibility is achieved.\nTEXT: At grant, option awards have a term life of ten years. For awards granted prior to 2016, if the “Long Service Separation” criteria are met, the vested options have a life that is the lesser of ten years from the original grant date or five years from the separation date. For awards granted beginning in 2016, the vested options have a life equal to ten years from the original grant date.\nTEXT: Accounting guidance on share-based payments requires companies to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The fair value of our option grants was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility, risk-free interest rate and historical employee behavior. Expected volatility was based on historical Caterpillar stock price movement and current implied volatilities from traded options on Caterpillar stock.

Derivative financial instruments and risk management\nTEXT: Our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and certain deferred compensation plan liabilities. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, commodity price and certain deferred compensation plan liability exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity forward and option contracts and total return swap contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. We present at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on our risk management practices, including our use of financial derivative instruments.\nTEXT: We recognize all derivatives at their fair value in Statement 3. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. For foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges, the interim settlements are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument within Interest expense. We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, in Statement 3 until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on Statement 5. We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on Statement 5.\nTEXT: We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities in Statement 3 and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\nTEXT: We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\nTITLE: A.Foreign currency exchange rate risk\n"

Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\nTEXT: We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: In managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities. We designate float-to-float cross currency contracts as fair value hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities.\nTITLE: B.Interest rate risk\nTEXT: Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nTEXT: We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products. We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the original term of the previously designated hedged item.\nTITLE: C.Commodity price risk\nTEXT: Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\nTEXT: Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.\n"

Non-U.S. entities that have not demonstrated consistent and/or sustainable profitability to support the realization of net deferred tax assets, including certain entities in Luxembourg, have recorded valuation allowances of $627 million against tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets.\nTEXT: A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including positions impacting only the timing of tax benefits, follows.\nTEXT: Reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits: 1 Years ended December 31,(Millions of dollars)202420232022Beginning balance$1,223 $1,140 $1,886 Additions for tax positions related to current year118 94 72 Additions for tax positions related to prior years49 42 91 Reductions for tax positions related to prior years(30)(19)(66)Reductions for settlements 2 (60)(27)(840)Reductions for expiration of statute of limitations(11)(7)(3)Ending balance$1,289 $1,223 $1,140 Amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate$1,137 $997 $874\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2024 2023 2022; Beginning balance $ 1,223 $ 1,140 $ 1,886; Additions for tax positions related to current year 118 94 72; Additions for tax positions related to prior years 49 42 91; Reductions for tax positions related to prior years (30) (19) (66); Reductions for settlements 2 (60) (27) (840); Reductions for expiration of statute of limitations (11) (7) (3); Ending balance $ 1,289 $ 1,223 $ 1,140; Amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate $ 1,137 $ 997 $ 874.\nTITLE: Reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits: 1\nTITLE: Years ended December 31,\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)202420232022\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Beginning balance$1,223 $1,140 $1,886\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,223\nTITLE: Additions for tax positions related to current year118 94 72\nTITLE: 118\nTITLE: Additions for tax positions related to prior years49 42 91\nTITLE: 49\nTITLE: Reductions for tax positions related to prior years(30)(19)(66)\nTITLE: (30)\nTITLE: Reductions for settlements 2 (60)(27)(840)\nTITLE: (60)\nTITLE: Reductions for expiration of statute of limitations(11)(7)(3)\nTITLE: (11)\nTITLE: Ending balance$1,289 $1,223 $1,140\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,289\nTITLE: Amount that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate$1,137 $997 $874\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,137\nTEXT: 1Foreign currency impacts are included within each line as applicable.\nTEXT: 2Includes cash payment or other reduction of assets to settle liability.\nTEXT: We classify interest and penalties on income taxes as a component of the provision for income taxes. We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $35 million, $36 million and $49 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $190 million and $135 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTEXT: On September 8, 2022, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that resolves all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016, without any penalties. The company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL) from certain parts transactions. We vigorously contested the IRS's application of the \"substance-over-form\" or \"assignment-of-income\" judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with associated interest of $250 million. The settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and enables us to avoid the costs and burdens of further disputes with the IRS. As a result of the settlement, we recorded a tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years' taxes and related interest, net of tax.\nTEXT: We are subject to the continuous examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns by the IRS, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nTITLE: 7.

Cat Financial also provides financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial's customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 51 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of December 31, 2024.\nTEXT: Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\nTEXT: During the year ended December 31, 2024, Cat Financial's forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as low delinquencies within their portfolio. However, industry delinquencies show an increasing trend as the central bank actions aimed at reducing inflation have weakened global economic growth. The company believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\nTITLE: Dealer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form of wholesale financing plans and short-term working capital loans. Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTEXT: In general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nTITLE: Classes of finance receivables\nTEXT: Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk.

Generally, the amount of the write-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the amortized cost of the receivable.

Typically, the types of modifications granted are payment deferrals, interest-only payment periods and/or term extensions. Many modifications Cat Financial grants are for commercial reasons or for borrowers experiencing some form of short-term financial stress and may result in insignificant payment delays. Cat Financial does not consider these borrowers to be experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications for borrowers Cat Financial does consider to be experiencing financial difficulty typically result in payment deferrals and/or reduced payments for a period of four months or longer, term extension of six months or longer or a combination of both.\nTEXT: During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no finance receivable modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in Cat Financial's Customer portfolio segment during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $33 million and $47 million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented 0.15 percent and 0.21 percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively.\nTEXT: The financial effects of term extensions and payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the years ended December 31, were as follows:\nTEXT: (In months)20242023Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts815Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods67\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts — 2024: 8; 2023: 15\nTABLE_ROW: Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods — 2024: 6; 2023: 7\nTITLE: (In months)20242023\nTITLE: (In months)\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts815\nTITLE: 8\nTITLE: Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods67\nTITLE: 6\nTEXT: After Cat Financial modifies a finance receivable, they continue to track its performance under its most recent modified terms.

On rare occasions when principal forgiveness is provided, the amount forgiven is written off against the allowance for credit losses.\nTITLE: D.

Rail’s product portfolio includes diesel-electric locomotives and other rail-related products and services. The annual impairment test completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated that the fair value of Rail was below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $925 million, resulting in a full impairment of Rail’s goodwill balance as of October 1, 2022. There was a $36 million tax benefit associated with this impairment charge. The valuation of the Rail reporting unit was based on estimates of future cash flows, which assumed a reduced demand forecast, lower margins due to continued inflationary cost pressures, and a discount rate approximately 140 basis points higher than utilized in the prior year valuation. The reduction in the demand forecast in the fourth quarter of 2022 was primarily driven by fourth quarter commercial developments, resulting in a lower outlook for the Company’s locomotive offerings.\nTEXT: The changes in carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)December 31, 2023Other Adjustments 1December 31, 2024Construction IndustriesGoodwill$277 $(16)$261 Impairments(22)— (22)Net goodwill255 (16)239 Resource IndustriesGoodwill4,151 (27)4,124 Impairments(1,175)— (1,175)Net goodwill2,976 (27)2,949 Energy & TransportationGoodwill2,959 (20)2,939 Impairment(925)— (925)Net goodwill2,034 (20)2,014 All Other 2Goodwill43 (4)39 Consolidated totalGoodwill7,430 (67)7,363 Impairments(2,122)— (2,122)Net goodwill$5,308 $(67)$5,241 December 31, 2022Other Adjustments 1December 31, 2023Construction IndustriesGoodwill$287 $(10)$277 Impairments(22)— (22)Net goodwill265 (10)255 Resource IndustriesGoodwill4,130 21 4,151 Impairments(1,175)— (1,175)Net goodwill2,955 21 2,976 Energy & TransportationGoodwill2,947 12 2,959 Impairment(925)— (925)Net goodwill2,022 12 2,034 All Other 2Goodwill46 (3)43 Consolidated totalGoodwill7,410 20 7,430 Impairments(2,122)— (2,122)Net goodwill$5,288 $20 $5,308 1 Other adjustments are comprised primarily of foreign currency translation.2 Includes All Other Segment (See Note 23).\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) December 31, 2023 Other Adjustments 1 December 31, 2024; Goodwill $ 277 $ (16) $ 261; Impairments (22) — (22); Net goodwill 255 (16) 239; Goodwill 4,151 (27) 4,124; Impairments (1,175) — (1,175); Net goodwill 2,976 (27) 2,949; Goodwill 2,959 (20) 2,939; Impairment (925) — (925); Net goodwill 2,034 (20) 2,014; Goodwill 43 (4) 39; Goodwill 7,430 (67) 7,363; Impairments (2,122) — (2,122); Net goodwill $ 5,308 $ (67) $ 5,241; December 31, 2022 Other Adjustments 1 December 31, 2023; Goodwill $ 287 $ (10) $ 277; Impairments (22) — (22); Net goodwill 265 (10) 255; Goodwill 4,130 21 4,151; Impairments (1,175) — (1,175); Net goodwill 2,955 21 2,976; Goodwill 2,947 12 2,959; Impairment (925) — (925); Net goodwill 2,022 12 2,034; Goodwill 46 (3) 43; Goodwill 7,410 20 7,430; Impairments (2,122) — (2,122); Net goodwill $ 5,288 $ 20 $ 5,308.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)December 31, 2023Other Adjustments 1December 31, 2024\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\n"

Our defined contribution plans allow employees to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement, and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution. The benefit obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil. For other postretirement benefits (OPEB), substantially all of our benefit obligation is for employees located in the United States.\n"

Plan assets\nTEXT: In general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions is designed to decrease funded status volatility through ongoing alignment of the interest rate sensitivity of our investments to our obligations, while reducing risk from return seeking assets in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset allocation is 85 percent fixed income and 15 percent equities. We will revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall objectives. The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations are 59 percent fixed income, 19 percent insurance contracts, 11 percent equities, 6 percent real estate, and 5 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants and funded status. We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in non-U.S. securities.\nTEXT: Our target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 40 percent equities and 60 percent fixed income.\nTEXT: We rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of risk within the portfolio of investments.\nTEXT: We permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.\nTEXT: The accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: We determine fair values as follows:\nTEXT: •Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical instruments in active markets.\nTEXT: •Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: •Real estate is stated at the fund’s net asset value or at appraised value.\nTEXT: •Insurance contracts are valued on an insurer pricing basis updated for changes in insurance market pricing, market rates, and inflation.\nTEXT: •Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying amount, which approximates fair value, or the fund’s net asset value.\nTEXT: The fair value of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets by category is summarized below:\nTEXT: December 31, 2024(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotal Assets at Fair ValueU.S. Pension Equity securities: U.S. equities$1,087 $— $28 $62 $1,177 Non-U.S. equities946 — 10 — 956 Fixed income securities: U.S. corporate bonds— 5,396 33 36 5,465 Non-U.S. corporate bonds— 972 — — 972 U.S. government bonds— 2,656 — — 2,656 U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities— 180 — — 180 Non-U.S. government bonds— 132 — — 132 Cash, short-term instruments and other48 12 — 300 360 Total U.S. pension assets$2,081 $9,348 $71 $398 $11,898\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measured at NAV Total Assets at Fair Value; U.S. equities $ 1,087 $ — $ 28 $ 62 $ 1,177; Non-U.S. equities 946 — 10 — 956; U.S. corporate bonds — 5,396 33 36 5,465; Non-U.S. corporate bonds — 972 — — 972; U.S. government bonds — 2,656 — — 2,656; U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities — 180 — — 180; Non-U.S. government bonds — 132 — — 132; Cash, short-term instruments and other 48 12 — 300 360; Total U.S. pension assets $ 2,081 $ 9,348 $ 71 $ 398 $ 11,898.\nTITLE: December 31, 2024\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotal Assets at Fair Value\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Measured at NAV\nTITLE: Total Assets at Fair Value\nTITLE: U.S. Pension\nTITLE: U.S. equities$1,087 $— $28 $62 $1,177\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,087\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 28\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 62\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,177\nTITLE: Non-U.S. equities946 — 10 — 956\nTITLE: 946\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 10\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 956\nTITLE: Fixed income securities:\nTITLE: U.S. corporate bonds— 5,396 33 36 5,465\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 5,396\nTITLE: 33\nTITLE: 36\nTITLE: 5,465\nTITLE: Non-U.S. corporate bonds— 972 — — 972\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 972\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 972\nTITLE: U.S. government bonds— 2,656 — — 2,656\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2,656\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2,656\nTITLE: U.S. governmental agency mortgage-backed securities— 180 — — 180\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 180\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 180\nTITLE: Non-U.S. government bonds— 132 — — 132\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 132\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 132\nTITLE: Cash, short-term instruments and other48 12 — 300 360\nTITLE: 48\nTITLE: 12\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 300\nTITLE: 360\nTITLE: Total U.S. pension assets$2,081 $9,348 $71 $398 $11,898\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,081\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,348\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 71\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 398\nTITLE: $\n"

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the ESOP held 10.4 million and 11.3 million shares, respectively. We allocate all of the shares held by the ESOP to participant accounts. Dividends paid to participants are automatically reinvested into company shares unless the participant elects to have all or a portion of the dividend paid to the participant.

These committed and uncommitted credit lines, which may be eligible for renewal at various future dates or have no specified expiration date, are used primarily by our subsidiaries for local funding requirements. Caterpillar or Cat Financial may guarantee subsidiary borrowings under these lines.\nTEXT: In the event Caterpillar or Cat Financial does not meet one or more of their respective financial covenants under the Credit Facility in the future (and are unable to obtain a consent or waiver), the syndicate of banks may terminate the commitments allocated to the party that does not meet its covenants. Additionally, in such event, certain of Cat Financial’s other lenders under other loan agreements where similar financial covenants or cross default provisions are applicable may, at their election, choose to pursue remedies under those loan agreements, including accelerating the repayment of outstanding borrowings.

This guidance also specifies a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used in valuation techniques. Observable inputs (highest level) reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest level) reflect internally developed market assumptions. In accordance with this guidance, fair value measurements are classified under the following hierarchy:\nTITLE: •Level 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nTEXT: •Level 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable in active markets.\n"

In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3.\nTEXT: We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. We may therefore classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nTEXT: Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\nTEXT: Investments in debt and equity securities\nTEXT: We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: We also have investments in time deposits classified as held-to-maturity debt securities. The fair value of these investments is based upon valuations observed in less active markets than Level 1. These investments have a maturity of less than one year and are recorded at amortized costs, which approximate fair value.\nTEXT: In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: See Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\nTEXT: Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. The fair value of total return swap contracts is primarily based on valuing the underlying securities or funds using pricing by industry providers and the average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread.\nTEXT: See Note 4 for additional information.\nTEXT: Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value included in Statement 3 as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nTEXT: December 31, 2024(Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair ValueAssets Debt securities Government debt securities U.S. treasury bonds$10 $— $— $— $10 Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds— 68 — — 68 Corporate debt securities Corporate bonds and other debt securities— 3,170 — — 3,170 Asset-backed securities— 219 — — 219 Mortgage-backed debt securities U.S. governmental agency— 443 — — 443 Residential— 2 — — 2 Commercial— 130 — — 130 Total debt securities10 4,032 — — 4,042 Equity securities Large capitalization value261 — — — 261 Smaller company growth41 — — — 41 REIT— — — 167 167 Total equity securities302 — — 167 469 Derivative financial instruments - assetsForeign currency contracts - net— 117 — — 117 Total assets$312 $4,149 $— $167 $4,628 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - liabilitiesInterest rate contracts - net$— $191 $— $— $191 Commodity contracts - net— 2 — — 2 Total return swap contracts - net— 33 — — 33 Total liabilities$— $226 $— $— $226\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measured at NAV TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value; U.S. treasury bonds $ 10 $ — $ — $ — $ 10; Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds — 68 — — 68; Corporate bonds and other debt securities — 3,170 — — 3,170; Asset-backed securities — 219 — — 219; U.S. governmental agency — 443 — — 443; Residential — 2 — — 2; Commercial — 130 — — 130; Total debt securities 10 4,032 — — 4,042; Large capitalization value 261 — — — 261; Smaller company growth 41 — — — 41; REIT — — — 167 167; Total equity securities 302 — — 167 469; Foreign currency contracts - net — 117 — — 117; Total assets $ 312 $ 4,149 $ — $ 167 $ 4,628; Interest rate contracts - net $ — $ 191 $ — $ — $ 191; Commodity contracts - net — 2 — — 2; Total return swap contracts - net — 33 — — 33; Total liabilities $ — $ 226 $ — $ — $ 226.\nTITLE: December 31, 2024\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Measured at NAV\nTITLE: TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\nTITLE: Assets\nTITLE: U.S. treasury bonds$10 $— $— $— $10\nTITLE: $\n"

A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. In these cases, an allowance for credit losses may be established based either on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivables’ effective interest rate, the fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent receivables, or the observable market price of the receivable. In determining collateral value, Cat Financial estimates the current fair market value of the collateral less selling costs. Cat Financial had loans carried at fair value of $59 million and $55 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n"

To determine the present value of lease payments for most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease commencement date. For certain property and information technology equipment leases, we have elected to separate payments for lease components from non-lease components. For all other leases, we have elected not to separate payments for lease and non-lease components. Our lease agreements may include options to extend or terminate the lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option, we have included the option in the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.

Lessor arrangements\nTEXT: We lease Caterpillar machinery, engines and other equipment to customers and dealers around the world, primarily through Cat Financial. Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.\nTEXT: We determine the residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends. We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\nTEXT: During the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\nTEXT: See Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\nTEXT: The carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\nTEXT: December 31,(Millions of dollars)20242023Equipment leased to others - at original cost$5,701 $5,837 Less: Accumulated depreciation(1,927)(1,902)Equipment leased to others - net$3,774 $3,935\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) 2024 2023; Equipment leased to others - at original cost $ 5,701 $ 5,837; Less: Accumulated depreciation (1,927) (1,902); Equipment leased to others - net $ 3,774 $ 3,935.\nTITLE: December 31,\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20242023\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Equipment leased to others - at original cost$5,701 $5,837\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 5,701\nTITLE: Less: Accumulated depreciation(1,927)(1,902)\nTITLE: (1,927)\nTITLE: Equipment leased to others - net$3,774 $3,935\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 3,774\nTEXT: Payments due for operating leases as of December 31, 2024, were as follows:\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20252026202720282029ThereafterTotal$868$555$317$176$67$37$2,020\nTABLE: TABLE: 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 Thereafter Total; $868 $555 $317 $176 $67 $37 $2,020.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20252026202720282029ThereafterTotal$868$555$317$176$67$37$2,020\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 20252026202720282029ThereafterTotal\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2026\nTITLE: 2027\nTITLE: 2028\nTITLE: 2029\nTITLE: Thereafter\nTITLE: Total\nTEXT: Revenues from finance and operating leases, primarily included in Revenues of Financial Products on Statement 1, were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)Year ended December 31,202420232022Finance lease revenue$440 $420 $430 Operating lease revenue1,212 1,166 1,085 Total$1,652 $1,586 $1,515\nTABLE: TABLE: 2024 2023 2022; Finance lease revenue $ 440 $ 420 $ 430; Operating lease revenue 1,212 1,166 1,085; Total $ 1,652 $ 1,586 $ 1,515.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Year ended December 31,\nTITLE: 202420232022\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Finance lease revenue$440 $420 $430\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 440\nTITLE: Operating lease revenue1,212 1,166 1,085\nTITLE: 1,212\nTITLE: Total$1,652 $1,586 $1,515\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,652\nTEXT: We present revenues net of sales and other related taxes.\nTITLE: 21.Guarantees and product warranty\n"

Under the guarantees, non-performance by the third parties could require Caterpillar to satisfy the contractual obligation by providing goods, services or financial compensation. The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts possibly recoverable) that we could be required to make under the guarantees was $368 million and $353 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTEXT: We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.\nTEXT: No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the SPC’s assets of $1.14 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1.14 billion and $1.35 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\nTEXT: Cat Financial has commitments to extend credit to customers through lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. Cat Financial applies the same credit policies and approval process for these commitments as we do for other financing. Collateral is not required, but if credit is extended, collateral is generally required upon funding. The unused commitments to extend credit to customers that are not unconditionally cancellable was $843 million at December 31, 2024. Cat Financial also has pre-approved lines of credit and other credit arrangements with Caterpillar dealers; however, we generally have the right to unconditionally cancel, alter, or amend the terms at any time.\nTEXT: We determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical claim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by machine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside or outside North America). We develop specific rates for each product shipment month and update them monthly based on actual warranty claim experience.\nTEXT: The reconciliation of the change in our product warranty liability balances for the years ended December 31, was as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)20242023Warranty liability, beginning of period$1,894 $1,761 Reduction in liability (payments)(824)(835)Increase in liability (new warranties)630 968 Warranty liability, end of period$1,700 $1,894\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Warranty liability, beginning of period — 2024: 1,894; 2023: 1,761\nTABLE_ROW: Reduction in liability (payments) — 2024: (824); 2023: (835)\nTABLE_ROW: Increase in liability (new warranties) — 2024: 630; 2023: 968\nTABLE_ROW: Warranty liability, end of period — 2024: 1,700; 2023: 1,894\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)20242023\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Warranty liability, beginning of period$1,894 $1,761\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,894\nTITLE: Reduction in liability (payments)(824)(835)\nTITLE: (824)\nTITLE: Increase in liability (new warranties)630 968\nTITLE: 630\nTITLE: Warranty liability, end of period$1,700 $1,894\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,700\n"

Environmental and legal matters\nTEXT: The Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing its use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\nTEXT: We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\nTEXT: Our operations in Brazil are subject to highly complex labor, tax, customs and other laws. While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws, we are periodically engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws, including certain tax and customs disputes with federal, state and municipal authorities in Brazil relating to export activities associated with Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential losses; however, we currently believe that any matters raised will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTEXT: In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTITLE: 23. Segment information\nTITLE: Segment information\nTITLE: A. Basis for segment information\nTEXT: Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The COO, Group Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the COO/Group President/CFO level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), and operating segments are primarily based on the COO/Group President/CFO reporting structure.\nTEXT: Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads one smaller operating segment that is included in the All Other Segment. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.\n"

Segment measurement and reconciliations\nTEXT: We determine the segment profit of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment on a pretax basis and exclude most interest expense and certain other income (expense) items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income (expense) items.\nTEXT: Our CODM evaluates the operating performance of the segments using segment profit as it provides insight into the financial health of each segment. The CODM reviews this metric regularly to compare the profitability of segments, identify trends, and evaluate which segments require additional resources or strategic adjustments. The CODM uses segment profit to support the allocation of resources predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. Additionally, the CODM monitors forecast-to-actual variances, focusing on areas where performance deviates from expectations, when evaluating the performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment.\nTEXT: There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:\nTEXT: •For Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment, net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. We generally manage at the corporate level liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances, and we do not include these in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\nTEXT: •We value segment inventories and cost of sales using a current cost methodology.\nTEXT: •We amortize goodwill allocated to segments using a fixed amount based on a 20-year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.\nTEXT: •We generally manage currency exposures for operating segments, other than Financial Products, at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.\nTEXT: •Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 119 to 120 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\nTEXT: •Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.\nTEXT: •Restructuring income/costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 24 for more information.\nTEXT: •Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: •Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, we report certain costs on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, sales and revenues by geographic region reconciled to consolidated sales and revenues were as follows:\n"

The restructuring costs in 2023 were primarily related to the divestiture of the company's Longwall business within Resource Industries. The divestiture closed on February 1, 2023 and resulted in a pre-tax loss of approximately $586 million, primarily a non-cash item driven by the release of $494 million of accumulated foreign currency translation. The restructuring costs in 2022 were primarily related to actions across the company, including $193 million related to the Rail division that was primarily inventory write-downs, and other strategic actions to address a small number of products. The inventory write-downs were included in \"Other\" in the table above.\nTEXT: In 2024, 2023 and 2022, all restructuring costs were excluded from segment profit.\n"
