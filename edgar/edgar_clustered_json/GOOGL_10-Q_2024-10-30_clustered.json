We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nTITLE: Deferred Revenues\nTEXT: We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.

Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.

These inputs significantly vary based on investment type.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities was $33.7 billion, of which $13.7 billion were remeasured at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and were primarily classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy at the time of measurement.\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Debt Securities\nTEXT: The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of investments in available-for-sale marketable debt securities by effective contractual maturity dates (in millions):\nTEXT: As ofSeptember 30, 2024Due in 1 year or less$5,439 Due in 1 year through 5 years36,972 Due in 5 years through 10 years12,416 Due after 10 years13,220 Total$68,047\nTABLE: TABLE: Due in 1 year or less $ 5,439; Due in 1 year through 5 years 36,972; Due in 5 years through 10 years 12,416; Due after 10 years 13,220; Total $ 68,047.\nTITLE: As ofSeptember 30, 2024\nTEXT: The following tables present fair values and gross unrealized losses recorded to AOCI, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 Less than 12 Months12 Months or GreaterTotal Fair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossGovernment bonds$1,456 $(22)$13,897 $(657)$15,353 $(679)Corporate debt securities827 (5)15,367 (592)16,194 (597)Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities2,945 (26)7,916 (608)10,861 (634)Total$5,228 $(53)$37,180 $(1,857)$42,408 $(1,910)\nTABLE: TABLE: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total; Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss; Government bonds $ 1,456 $ (22) $ 13,897 $ (657) $ 15,353 $ (679); Corporate debt securities 827 (5) 15,367 (592) 16,194 (597); Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities 2,945 (26) 7,916 (608) 10,861 (634); Total $ 5,228 $ (53) $ 37,180 $ (1,857) $ 42,408 $ (1,910).\nTITLE: As of December 31, 2023\nTITLE: Less than 12 Months12 Months or GreaterTotal\nTITLE: Less than 12 Months\nTITLE: 12 Months or Greater\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Fair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: UnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: UnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: UnrealizedLoss\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024 Less than 12 Months12 Months or GreaterTotal Fair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossGovernment bonds$2,636 $(18)$2,920 $(75)$5,556 $(93)Corporate debt securities570 (1)7,899 (193)8,469 (194)Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities142 0 4,312 (233)4,454 (233)Total$3,348 $(19)$15,131 $(501)$18,479 $(520)\nTABLE: TABLE: Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total; Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss Fair Value UnrealizedLoss; Government bonds $ 2,636 $ (18) $ 2,920 $ (75) $ 5,556 $ (93); Corporate debt securities 570 (1) 7,899 (193) 8,469 (194); Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities 142 0 4,312 (233) 4,454 (233); Total $ 3,348 $ (19) $ 15,131 $ (501) $ 18,479 $ (520).\nTITLE: As of September 30, 2024\nTITLE: Less than 12 Months12 Months or GreaterTotal\nTITLE: Less than 12 Months\nTITLE: 12 Months or Greater\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Fair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLossFair ValueUnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: UnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\nTITLE: UnrealizedLoss\nTITLE: Fair Value\n"

The results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us, and their creditors do not have recourse to us. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $4.9 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.\nTEXT: We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments.

We have agreed to defend and/or hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nTEXT: It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nTEXT: Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses. The outcomes of outstanding legal\nTEXT: matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and could, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect.\nTEXT: We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\n"

The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of June 27, 2017) fine. We appealed the EC decision and implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC's decision. On September 10, 2024, the European Court of Justice rejected our appeal and upheld the €2.4 billion fine imposed in 2017. In the third quarter of 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the 2017 shopping fine.\nTEXT: •On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, and on October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. On September 14, 2022, the General Court reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently filed an appeal with the European Court of Justice. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\nTEXT: •On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. On September 18, 2024, the European Union’s (EU) General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has until November 28, 2024 to appeal the decision.\nTEXT: In addition, on July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories. The U.S. District Court subsequently vacated the trial date with the states, and we expect any final approval of the settlement would come in 2024. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\nTEXT: In December 2023, a California jury delivered a verdict in a similar lawsuit in Epic Games v. Google. The jury found that Google violated antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision on October 7, 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing and have filed a motion to pause the implementation of some of the remedies pending the appeal. The trial court judge has temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal.\nTEXT: From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on various competition matters by regulatory authorities in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions globally. Examples, for which given their nature we cannot estimate a possible loss include:\nTEXT: •In August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. The trial ended on November 16, 2023, and on August 5, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and the United Kingdom's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices.\n"

Additionally, on January 24, 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed an antitrust complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google’s digital advertising technology products violate U.S. antitrust laws, and on April 17, 2023, a number of additional state Attorneys General joined the complaint. The trial ended on September 27, 2024, and we expect a decision in late 2024 or early 2025. The EC, the CMA, and the ACCC each opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices on June 22, 2021, May 25, 2022, and June 29, 2022, respectively. On June 14, 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections (SO) informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology. We responded to the SO on December 1, 2023. On September 6, 2024, the CMA issued an SO informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated UK competition laws relating to its advertising technology. We will respond to the SO.\nTEXT: •In May 2022, the EC and the CMA each opened investigations into Google Play’s business practices. The EC closed its initial investigation, but is now investigating Google Play’s compliance with certain provisions of EU’s Digital Markets Act. Korean regulators are investigating Google Play's billing practices, including a formal review in May 2022 of Google's compliance with the new app store billing regulations.\nTEXT: We believe we have strong arguments against these claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nTITLE: Privacy Matters\nTEXT: We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nTITLE: Patent and Intellectual Property Claims\nTEXT: We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nTEXT: Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nTITLE: Other\nTEXT: We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nTEXT: We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n"

The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.

We use non-GAAP constant currency revenues (\"constant currency revenues\") and non-GAAP percentage change in constant currency revenues (\"percentage change in constant currency revenues\") for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance, because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nTEXT: Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as revenues excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movements (\"FX Effect\") as well as hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level.

Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects realized in the current period.\nTEXT: Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nTEXT: These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.

These amounts primarily consist of purchase orders for certain technical infrastructure as well as the non-cancelable portion or the minimum cancellation fee in certain agreements related to commitments to purchase licenses, including content licenses, inventory, and network capacity. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the non-cancelable obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of September 30, 2024. In certain instances, the amount of our contractual obligations may change based on the expected timing of order fulfillment from our suppliers. For more information related to our content licenses, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nTEXT: In addition, we regularly enter into multi-year, non-cancellable agreements to purchase renewable energy and energy attributes, such as renewable energy certificates. These agreements do not include a minimum dollar commitment. The amounts to be paid under these agreements are based on the actual volumes to be generated and are not readily determinable.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: See Part II, Item 7, \"Critical Accounting Estimates\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n"
