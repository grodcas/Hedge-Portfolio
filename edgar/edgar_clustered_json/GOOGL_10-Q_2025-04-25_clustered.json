Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as amounts that will be invoiced in future periods, and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or less and cancellable contracts.\nTITLE: Deferred Revenues\nTEXT: We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.

Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.

These leases will commence between 2025 and 2031 with non-cancelable lease terms between one and 25 years.\nTITLE: Consolidated VIEs\nTEXT: We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary.

As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs were $8.7 billion and $7.8 billion, respectively, and are primarily included in cash and cash equivalents on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2025, liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs were $2.3 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.

These VIEs include private companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve power generation using renewable sources.\nTEXT: We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We account for these investments primarily as non-marketable equity securities or equity method investments, which are included within non-marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the investments and any future funding commitments.

We have agreed to defend and/or indemnify certain parties against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.

Additionally, the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position.

In 2024, we made a cash payment of $3.0 billion for the fine.\nTEXT: •Android: In July 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related distribution agreements infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a €4.3 billion fine, and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. We appealed the EC decision and implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution practices. In September 2022, the General Court affirmed the EC decision but reduced the fine from €4.3 billion to €4.1 billion. We subsequently appealed the General Court's affirmation of the EC decision with the European Court of Justice, which remains pending. In 2018, we recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine, which we reduced by $217 million in 2022.\nTEXT: •AdSense for Search: In March 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google's agreements with AdSense for Search partners infringed European antitrust laws, imposed a fine of €1.5 billion, and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' agreements, which we implemented\nTEXT: prior to the decision. In 2019, we recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine and appealed the EC decision. In September 2024, the General Court overturned the EC decision and annulled the €1.5 billion fine. The EC has appealed the General Court's decision with the European Court of Justice.\nTEXT: •Search: In October 2020, the DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and Search advertising. In August 2024, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Google violated such U.S. antitrust laws. A separate proceeding is being held to determine remedies, the range of which vary widely. The DOJ has proposed a high level remedy framework, which includes alterations to our products and services and our business models and operations, including structural remedies, and/or our distribution arrangements, among other changes, some of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We have filed our own remedies proposal ahead of a hearing on remedies in April 2025. We expect a decision likely in the second half of 2025, after which we intend to appeal.\nTEXT: Further, in June 2022, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and in October 2023, the Japanese Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) each opened an investigation into Search distribution practices. In April 2025, the JFTC issued a cease-and-desist order requiring us to make changes to our Android agreements to ensure they are consistent with Japanese antitrust law. The JFTC did not impose monetary penalties. We are constructively engaging with JFTC regarding compliance with the order.\nTEXT: Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTEXT: •Advertising Technology: In December 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology, and a trial is scheduled for August 2025. Additionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit. In April 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia issued a mixed decision in the DOJ case against Google, ruling that the DOJ failed to show that Google’s advertiser tools or acquisitions of DoubleClick and AdMeld were anticompetitive, but that Google’s publisher tools violated antitrust laws by excluding rivals. We plan to appeal the adverse portion of this decision.\nTEXT: Further, in June 2023, the EC issued a Statement of Objections informing Google of its preliminary view that Google violated European antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, to which we responded. In September 2024, the UK also issued a Statement of Objections on similar grounds, to which we responded.\nTEXT: Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTEXT: •Google Play: In July 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. In September 2023, we reached a settlement in principle with 50 state Attorneys General and three territories and recognized a charge. Final approval of the settlement remains pending before the court. In May 2024, we funded the settlement amount to an escrow agent.\n"

Google finding that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws related to Google Play's business. Epic did not seek monetary damages. The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play. We are appealing the verdict and the trial court judge temporarily paused the implementation of the remedies while the Court of Appeals considers our request to pause implementation of the remedies pending the duration of the appeal. Given the nature of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTEXT: •European Digital Markets Act: In March 2024, the EC opened two investigations regarding Google's compliance with certain provisions of EU's Digital Markets Act relating to Google Play and Search. In March 2025, the EC issued preliminary findings of non-compliance in both investigations, to which we plan to respond in the coming weeks. Given the preliminary stages of this matter, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTEXT: In addition to these antitrust proceedings, private individual and collective actions that overlap with claims pursued by regulatory authorities are pending in the U.S. and in several other jurisdictions, including across Europe. Given the nature of these matters, we cannot estimate a possible loss.\nTEXT: We believe we have strong arguments against these open claims and will defend ourselves vigorously. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other regulators around the world.\nTITLE: Privacy Matters\nTEXT: We are subject to a number of privacy-related laws and regulations, and we currently are party to a number of privacy investigations and lawsuits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. For example, there are ongoing investigations and litigation in the U.S. and the EU, including those relating to our collection and use of location information, alleged violations of state biometric statutes, the choices we offer users, and advertising practices, which could result in significant fines, judgments, and product changes.\nTITLE: Patent and Intellectual Property Claims\nTEXT: We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nTEXT: Further, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nTITLE: Other\nTEXT: We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. For example, we periodically have data incidents that we report to relevant regulators as required by law. Such claims, consent orders, lawsuits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing monitoring and auditing obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nTEXT: We have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. For example, some matters concern civil judgments that include compounding penalties imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not expect these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\nTITLE: Non-Income Taxes\nTEXT: We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\nTEXT: See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\n"
