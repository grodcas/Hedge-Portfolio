As part of this transformation, we implemented the 2025 Restructuring Plan to lower expenses, streamline our organizational structure and reduce management layers across functions while reallocating resources toward our core client and server businesses by reducing investment in lower-priority programs and initiatives. We expect these headcount reduction initiatives will reduce our core Intel workforce by 15% by the end of fiscal 2025. As a result of initiating and deploying the 2025 Restructuring Plan, and substantially completing the 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $1.9 billion in Q2 2025, primarily comprised of the following:\n"

This determination was based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services. These non-cash charges of $797 million, net of certain items, were recorded to cost of sales in Q2 2025, impacting the results for our Intel Foundry segment.\nTEXT: As part of the transformation of the company, we have begun implementing a more disciplined approach to the deployment of capital. The design, development, and manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, is risky and capital-intensive, and it takes years for capital investments to yield a return. Under our more disciplined approach, we intend to invest capital in future node development and additional or upgraded manufacturing facilities only where we have a clear line of sight to an acceptable return on that capital. We expect to release the first SKU of our first products manufactured on our new leading-edge node, Intel 18A, by the end of 2025, and continue to develop its derivative node, Intel 18A-P, designed for future Intel products and external customers. We are focused on the continued development of Intel 14A, the next generation node beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P, and on securing a significant external customer for such node. However, if we are unable to secure a significant external customer and meet important customer milestones for Intel 14A, we face the prospect that it will not be economical to develop and manufacture Intel 14A and successor leading-edge nodes on a go-forward basis. In such event, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of Intel 14A and successor nodes and various of our manufacturing expansion projects. While we continue to evaluate Intel 14A for use in future Intel products and our plan includes an initial product designed to utilize Intel 14A, at present we are maintaining the option to design future Intel products requiring nodes with performance beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P to be produced internally or by an external foundry. If we were to discontinue development of Intel 14A and successor nodes, we expect that a majority of our products would continue to be manufactured in our own facilities utilizing our nodes up to Intel 18A-P through at least 2030. By focusing on our customers and delivering the best semiconductor products to the market, manufactured on the most appropriate internal or external node from a performance and cost perspective, and only deploying capital on new nodes and manufacturing facilities where we believe they will yield an attractive return, we believe we can improve the competitiveness of our products business, and the overall financial results for the company.\nTEXT: Separately, in recent months, hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region escalated significantly with direct military actions between Israel and Iran and military strikes by the United States against Iran. There can be no assurance that any existing or future ceasefire agreements will be respected or remain in force, and additional hostilities and escalations remain possible at any time. We continue to monitor the impact this geopolitical conflict could have on our operations in Israel, including potential disruption of our wafer fabrication facility and our product development centers. To date, we have not had a material interruption in either our manufacturing operations or our product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions resulting from war or political violence, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and equipment assets in Israel are self-insured for losses resulting from war or political violence and could be impacted by the conflict.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we made an organizational change to integrate NEX into CCG and DCAI and modified our segment reporting to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance. There were no changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Our discussion regarding our segments' results of operations presented below excludes the $1.9 billion of restructuring and other charges in Q2 2025 and similar charges for the other periods presented, as our CODM receives, views and uses information for decision making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items. \"Note 2: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q provides additional information about our operating segments, including the nature of segment revenues and expenses, and reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total consolidated net revenues and our segment operating income (loss) presented below to our total consolidated operating income (loss) for each of the periods presented.\n"

Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; investments in our product roadmap; working capital requirements including cash outlays associated with the 2025 Restructuring Plan; partner distributions to our non-controlling interest holders; and strategic investments. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in manufacturing expansion plans and investments to advance our process technology. These plans include expanding existing operations in Arizona, New Mexico, and Oregon, investing in a new leading-edge manufacturing facility in Ohio, and may also include longer-term projects.\nTEXT: In November 2024, we signed a Direct Funding Agreement with the US Department of Commerce for the award of $7.9 billion in government incentives pursuant to the CHIPS Act, from which we have received $2.2 billion of cash to date, $1.1 billion of which was received in Q1 2025. We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, though recent US government actions create uncertainty as to whether the US government will fulfill its obligation under our CHIPS Act agreements, and support future awards in the US. These government incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities, and our related workforce, prior to submitting a claim for reimbursement. As of the end of Q2 2025, we have submitted claims for $850 million pursuant to our Direct Funding Agreement for which we have not received reimbursement. To the extent we delay or cancel capital investments or otherwise are unable or fail to comply with the terms of the agreements, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may forfeit or be required to repay, the associated government incentives.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we closed the second phase of our NAND memory business divestiture and received $1.9 billion of cash proceeds, net of certain adjustments. See \"Note 9: Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.\nTEXT: In Q2 2025, we signed a transaction agreement with SLP VII Gryphon Aggregator, L.P., an affiliate of Silver Lake Partners, to sell 51% of all issued and outstanding common stock of Altera, a wholly owned subsidiary, which is expected to result in receipt of net cash proceeds of $4.4 billion at closing, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2025, with an additional $1.0 billion of the purchase price deferred and payable in two equal $500 million installments no later than December 31, 2026 and December 31, 2027.

These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the amounts and timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. While such actions have benefited, and may further benefit, cash flow in the near term, we may experience a corresponding detriment to cash flow in future periods as these actions cease or as the impacts of these actions reverse or normalize.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we amended our 364-day $8.0 billion credit facility agreement to $5.0 billion and the maturity date was extended by one year to January 2026. Additionally, we have access to our $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which remains available until February 2029. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of June 28, 2025, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See \"Note 10: Borrowings\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. As part of our ongoing capital management strategy to optimize our debt portfolio and reduce interest expense, we may utilize make-whole provisions, tender offers or open market repurchases to repurchase our debt prior to maturity. In YTD 2025 and YTD 2024, we did not extinguish any debt prior to maturity.\nTEXT: We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country.

These unfavorable cash movements were partially offset by the cash favorable impacts of lower debt-related repayments and no dividend payments in the first six months of 2025 compared to the first six months of 2024.\nTEXT: Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with US GAAP, which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time such estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements could be affected. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of inventories, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and loss contingencies. The discussion provided below supplements the significant accounting policies disclosures provided within \"Note 2: Accounting Policies\" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024.\nTEXT: ▪ Inventories— inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and includes assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use a demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. Significant assumptions and estimates, which evolve each forecast cycle, that are utilized in our demand forecast and obsolete and excess inventory reserves process include:\nTEXT: •customer and product-related factors, including a review of our customer base, the stage of the product life cycle, including limitations to demand forecasting for new products with minimal historical data, variations in market pricing, and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost;\nTEXT: •market and economic factors, including cyclical changes in market conditions, the introduction of new or alternative products in the marketplace, and the associated pricing environment; and\nTEXT: •other factors, including tariff and export controls.\n"

If our assumptions and estimates for our demand forecast materially fluctuate and we fail to adjust manufacturing output accordingly or such assumptions and estimates are materially inaccurate, the related obsolete and excess inventory reserves can be materially impacted and result in reduced inventory values for products that we estimate have substantial sales risk. Our estimates for obsolete and excess inventory reserves were materially consistent with actual results in the first half of 2025, in 2024 and in 2023; however, our assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain, and our gross profit would be adversely affected if future demand is less favorable than forecasted.\nTEXT: ▪ Property, plant and equipment—at least annually, we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant, and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives. In the second quarter of 2025 and in 2024, we evaluated our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services, and concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements, which resulted in us shortening the useful lives of certain placed-in-service equipment and recording accelerated depreciation charges of $337 million and $992 million, respectively. In 2023, we determined that the estimated useful lives of certain production-related machinery and equipment should be increased from 5 to 8 years and, when compared to the estimated useful life in place as of the end of 2022, we estimated this change increased gross profit in 2023 by approximately $2.5 billion and decreased R&D expense by approximately $400 million and decreased ending inventory values by approximately $1.3 billion.\nTEXT: Our property, plant and equipment are subject to periodic impairment reviews. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of certain property, plant and equipment, significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations for which property, plant and equipment relate, and significant negative industry or economic trends. To perform an impairment review, our property, plant and equipment are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which requires management judgment to form asset groupings and to estimate expected cash flows that are attributable to asset groupings, among other factors. If an indicator of impairment is identified at the asset grouping level, we measure the recoverability of the assets by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flows arising from the use of that asset grouping. If an asset grouping carrying value is not determined to be recoverable through this undiscounted cash flows analysis, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The resulting charge is classified to expense, which is typically to cost of sales in a similar manner as the corresponding depreciation expense and results in a negative impact to our gross profit in that period. In the second quarter of 2025 and in 2024, we determined certain property and equipment, which had not yet been placed in service, exceeded our projected capacity requirements and incurred non-cash charges of $460 million and $2.3 billion, respectively.\nTEXT: ▪ Goodwill—We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. We have eight reporting units with allocated goodwill, which generally align to our operating segments. We reevaluate our identified reporting units annually or when triggered, such as upon reorganization of our operating segments or due to business reasons that result in material changes as to how our reporting units are organized and managed. Impairment assessments may be qualitative or quantitative in nature. A quantitative assessment is required if we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value, or if there are material changes to the structure of our reporting units. The reporting unit's carrying value used in an impairment assessment represents the allocation of various assets and liabilities, excluding certain corporate assets and liabilities, such as cash, investments, and debt. While a substantial majority of our allocable assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, are attributable to our Intel Foundry reporting unit, that reporting unit has no remaining allocated goodwill.\n"

More specifically, qualitative factors may include a sustained decrease in our consolidated market capitalization or one of our reporting units’ market capitalization relative to each’s respective net book value; significant company specific actions, including changes to the structure of our reporting units; and current, historical or projected deterioration of our financial performance. We may also perform a quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factors by applying sensitivities to assumptions and inputs used in measuring a reporting unit's fair value.\nTEXT: Our quantitative impairment assessment considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value. The income approach estimates fair value using discounted future cash flows for a reporting unit primarily using the following major assumptions and inputs: revenue, based on assumed market segment growth rates and our assumed market segment share; estimated costs; and appropriate discount rates based on a reporting unit's weighted average cost of capital. Our quantitative impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in underlying estimates and assumptions, the most sensitive of which is the discount rate. The major inputs and assumptions used in estimating discounted cash flows are derived from historical data, various internal estimates, and a variety of external sources, which are similar to those used in our business planning and forecasting processes. We test the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. Our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and change over time based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors and could materially affect the determination of the fair value and potential goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nTITLE: Table of Contents\nTEXT: The market approach estimates fair value using financial multiples and transaction prices of comparable companies.\nTEXT: To corroborate our fair value conclusions, we combine the estimated fair values for all reporting units and perform a market capitalization reconciliation as of the goodwill assessment date to validate the reasonableness of the implied control premium.\nTEXT: In the fourth quarter of 2024, as a part of our annual goodwill impairment assessment, we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the assigned carrying value, with the exception of one reporting unit with a significant amount of assigned goodwill: Mobileye. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.8 billion, substantially all of which related to our Mobileye reporting unit, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value. As of June 28, 2025, our Mobileye reporting unit had $8.2 billion in recorded goodwill. Mobileye’s market capitalization has increased substantially since the third quarter of 2024 and, while no additional impairment was recognized within the first half of 2025, we continue to closely monitor the Mobileye reporting unit’s financial performance, business forecasts, and market capitalization. As of June 28, 2025, the estimated fair value of the Mobileye reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value. Should our estimates change based on Mobileye’s operating results, market conditions, or other factors in our forecast, including changes in the discount rate, the Mobileye reporting unit may become subject to further impairment in future periods. For example, a 1% increase in the discount rate would have resulted in an additional impairment of our Mobileye reporting unit’s goodwill of approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: ▪ Loss contingencies—we are subject to loss contingencies, including various legal and regulatory proceedings, asserted and potential claims, liabilities related to repair or replacement of parts in connection with product defects, as well as product warranties that arise in the ordinary course of business and are subject to change, including due to sudden or rapid developments in proceedings or claims. An estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. Certain factors have resulted in significant changes to our judgments and estimates that we made regarding these matters in previous quarters based on updated information that became available. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nTITLE: Table of Contents\nTEXT: Risk Factors and Other Key Information\n"

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections, we have provided an additional risk factor below regarding uncertainties surrounding our pursuit of next generation leading-edge process technologies and the impact they could have on our financial results.\nTEXT: If we are unable to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of next generation leading-edge process technologies, which may have significant strategic business, financial, operational and reputational risks and repercussions.\nTEXT: As an integrated design manufacturer (IDM) with a products business that depends on access to leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, to produce competitive products, we have historically invested significant capital resources to continually develop new generations of leading-edge nodes and foundry capacity to produce such nodes. However, the design, development, and manufacturing of leading-edge nodes is risky and capital-intensive, and it takes years for capital investments to yield a return. If we are unable to secure a significant external customer for our Intel 14A node, we may pause or discontinue development of Intel 14A and subsequent next generation leading-edge nodes. While we remain focused on continued development of Intel 14A and securing such a significant external customer, we have taken steps to reduce our overall investment and have further slowed down the construction of the new leading-edge fabrication facilities we are building in Ohio. In addition, while we continue to evaluate Intel 14A for use in future Intel products and our plan includes an initial product designed to utilize Intel 14A, at present we are maintaining the option to design future Intel products requiring nodes with performance beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P to be produced internally or by an external foundry. We have been unsuccessful to date in securing any significant external foundry customers for any of our nodes and our prospects for securing a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A are uncertain.\nTEXT: If we were to pause or discontinue the design, development, and manufacturing of Intel 14A and other next generation leading-edge nodes, we would be subject to a number of significant strategic business, financial, operational and reputational risks and repercussions including, but not limited to:\nTEXT: ▪Dependence on Third-Party Foundries: Our products business would, over time, become dependent on third-party foundries, particularly TSMC, as we develop products for nodes beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P. We have no long-term contract with TSMC, and if we are unable to secure and maintain sufficient capacity on favorable pricing terms, we may be unable to manufacture our products in sufficient volume and at a cost that supports the continued success of our products business. Further, most of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with TSMC and other third-party foundries than we do, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage. There are few foundries capable of producing the leading-edge and near-leading-edge nodes needed for our products – currently only TSMC and Samsung. To the extent our competitors are more successful than us in securing capacity with those foundries than we are, our product roadmap, market position, and customer relationships would be materially adversely impacted.\nTEXT: ▪Losses with respect to our Investments in R&D and Manufacturing Facilities and Equipment: We had over $100 billion of property, plant, and equipment, net on our balance sheet as of June 28, 2025, the substantial majority of which we estimate relate to our foundry business. While the significant majority of this relates to our existing and in-development nodes, including Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P, with each transition to a new node we continue to utilize some R&D and manufacturing assets from prior nodes. If we were to pause or discontinue the design, development, and manufacturing of Intel 14A and other next generation leading-edge nodes, we would expect to incur significant material impairments with respect to foundry assets that may impact our results of operations. For example, we would likely discontinue the new leading-edge fabrication facilities we are building in Ohio. We also would expect to incur additional costs and expenses as we wind down other projects and facilities and reduce headcount.\n"

We have also entered into other government incentive arrangements with local, regional, and national governments, both US and non-US. If we were to pause or discontinue the design, development, and manufacturing of Intel 14A, we may lose eligibility for various incentives contemplated by these arrangements, and we may be required to repay amounts already received under these arrangements.\nTEXT: ▪Potential Penalty Payments Under our SCIP Agreements: To support our capital investments in recent years, we pursued alternative financing arrangements including our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus and our 2024 joint investment with Apollo related to Fab 34 in Ireland. Our potential pause or discontinuation of the design, development, and manufacture of Intel 14A may accelerate our move to third-party foundry services for our products and result in our inability to satisfy construction and/or wafer demand and purchase commitments in those arrangements, potentially requiring substantial additional payments to our SCIP partners.\nTEXT: ▪Loss of Talent: Historically, as one of the only companies in the world, and the only company in the U.S., pursuing the design, development and manufacturing of next generation leading-edge nodes, we have benefitted from being in a unique position as an employer to hire and retain scientists, engineers, and other technical talent interested in being on the cutting edge of semiconductor innovation. If we were to pause or discontinue leading-edge node design, development, and manufacturing, or any perception that we may do so in the future, may materially adversely impact our ability to hire and retain key talent across our foundry organization and the company more broadly, and we risk substantial loss of historical, technical, and other expertise.\nTEXT: ▪Limited External Foundry Potential: We have been unsuccessful to date in attracting significant customers to our external foundry business. If we were to pause or discontinue our pursuit of Intel 14A and successor nodes, it is highly uncertain whether we would be able to develop this business. Among other things, our existing nodes (Intel 7, Intel 4 and Intel 3) were designed for Intel products, and if potential customers for our upcoming Intel 18A-P node believe we are no longer committed to continued development of next generation leading-edge nodes (Intel 14A and beyond), they may be inclined to remain with their current foundry partners and unwilling to make the significant investments of time and resources needed to develop products on our nodes.\nTEXT: ▪Other Significant Financial, Operational, and Reputational Risks: If we pause or discontinue the design, development and manufacture of Intel 14A and future leading-edge nodes, it may give rise to additional material risks that we are not able to foresee or that are more significant than we anticipate, including, but not limited to, adverse impacts to our relationships and the terms of our engagements with customers, suppliers, and strategic partners, potential credit rating risk, and diminished investor confidence and increased stock price volatility. It is also uncertain what actions, if any, may be taken by the U.S. and other governments to the extent they view a potential discontinuation of our leading-edge process technology design, development, and manufacturing as a strategic risk from a national economic or defense perspective.\nTEXT: Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, operations, financial position, cash flows, access to financing, cost structure, competitiveness, reputation, profitability, and prospects and could exacerbate other risks discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K and Q1 2025 Form 10-Q. Further, given the decades of significant continuous investments in R&D, talent accumulation, intellectual property, state-of-the-art facilities, and technical know-how needed to compete in leading-edge node design, development and manufacturing, any decision to pause or discontinue our pursuit of Intel 14A and successor leading-edge process technologies may be effectively irreversible.\nTEXT: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nTEXT: We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. We performed an evaluation of these risks to our financial positions as of December 28, 2024, and updated that analysis as of June 28, 2025, to determine whether material changes in market risks pertaining to currency and interest rates or equity and commodity prices have occurred as a result of the changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls. No material revisions were noted since disclosing \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A, in our 2024 Form 10-K. Risks related to changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, particularly those involving the United States and China are described under \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information in our 2024 Form 10-K and in our Q1 2025 Form 10-Q.\nTEXT: Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\n"

Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nTEXT: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nTEXT: Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nTEXT: Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 28, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nTEXT: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTEXT: We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending June 28, 2025. As of June 28, 2025, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.\nTEXT: We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.\nTEXT: Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nTEXT: Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended June 28, 2025, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.\nTEXT: Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nTEXT: Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.\nTEXT: On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.\nTEXT: Amendment and Restatement of 2006 Equity Incentive Plan\n"
