In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire year. As a result, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2024 Form 10-K.

Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to our receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at May 4, 2025 or February 2, 2025.\nTITLE: Supplier Finance Program\nTEXT: We have a supplier finance program whereby participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, elect to receive payment for one or more of our payment obligations, prior to their scheduled due dates, at a discounted price from participating financial institutions. The payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers are consistent, irrespective of whether a supplier participates in the program, and we are not a party to the agreements between the participating financial institutions and the suppliers in connection with the program. We do not reimburse suppliers for any costs they incur for participation in the program, and we have not pledged any assets as security or provided any guarantees as part of the program. Our outstanding payment obligations under our supplier finance program were $425 million at May 4, 2025 and $598 million at February 2, 2025 and are recorded within accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: In fiscal 2024, the Internal Revenue Service provided automatic income tax relief to taxpayers in certain southeastern states, extending the timeline to make certain tax payments. As a result, our fourth quarter fiscal 2024 estimated federal tax payment was deferred and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, which increased our cash paid for income taxes in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nTEXT: We did not adopt any new accounting pronouncements during the three months ended May 4, 2025 that had a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. There have been no significant changes in accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as disclosed in the 2024 Form 10-K, and those not discussed in the 2024 Form 10-K are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTITLE: 2.SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\nTITLE: SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\nTITLE: Segment Reporting\nTEXT: The Company defines its segments based on how internally reported financial information is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), our President and Chief Executive Officer, to analyze financial performance, make decisions, and allocate resources.\nTEXT: Primary Segment. We are engaged in the operation of retail stores and sell a wide assortment of building materials, home improvement products, lawn and garden products, décor products, and facilities maintenance, repair and operations products both in stores and online. We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services, and tool and equipment rental. We currently conduct these operations in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents an operating segment. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three geographic operating segments into one reportable segment (the “Primary segment”) due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.\nTEXT: Other. As discussed in Note 10, in June 2024, we acquired SRS, a leading residential specialty trade distribution company across several verticals serving the professional roofer, landscaper and pool contractor through its branches located throughout the U.S. SRS is organized as three different lines of business: roofing and complementary building products, landscape, and pool. We have determined that each of these three lines of business represents an operating segment, none of which meets the thresholds prescribed under Topic 280 to be deemed a reportable segment. Therefore, results from our SRS operating segments are presented in “Other” beginning from the acquisition date of June 18, 2024.\nTEXT: Segment Information.

Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and to minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of certain senior notes.\nTEXT: We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at both May 4, 2025 and February 2, 2025.

At May 4, 2025 and February 2, 2025, the fair values of these agreements totaled $661 million and $795 million, respectively, all of which are recognized in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt.

We primarily used a combination of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, the issuance of long-term debt, as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisition. In fiscal 2024, we recorded a preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated acquisition date fair values. Adjustments to this preliminary purchase price allocation recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were immaterial, and our purchase price allocation is now finalized.\nTEXT: There were no material changes during the first three months of fiscal 2025 to our disclosure in Part I, Item 3. “Legal Proceedings” of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nTEXT: SEC regulations require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state or local environmental regulations if we reasonably believe that such proceedings may result in monetary sanctions above a stated threshold. Pursuant to SEC regulations, the Company uses a threshold of $1 million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such proceedings is required. Accordingly, below we have provided an update regarding the civil consent decree we entered into with the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and the states of Utah, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island in April 2021.\nTEXT: As previously reported, the decree required certain changes to lead-safe work practices in our installation services business and provided for stipulated penalties for failure to perform by third-party installers. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the EPA informed us that it believes we owe certain penalties for violations by third-party installers of documentation requirements under the decree. We are discussing with the EPA the basis for the stipulated penalties we allegedly owe under the decree and the aggregate amount of any stipulated penalties owed for the 42-month duration of the decree. We expect the decree to be terminated thereafter. While we cannot predict the aggregate amount of stipulated penalties we may ultimately owe to the EPA under the decree, such payments to date have totaled approximately $1.5 million, and we do not expect any such penalties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Further, we have collected fines from our installers for the approximately $1.5 million paid to date, and we expect to recoup any additional amount we ultimately owe from corresponding fines we levy against our third-party installers.\n"

This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $2.3 billion for dividends, repay $1.1 billion of long-term debt, and repay $278 million of net commercial paper borrowings. In addition, we funded $806 million in capital expenditures.

The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC.\nTITLE: Tariffs and Other Trade Policy Matters\nTEXT: We are closely monitoring developments with respect to tariffs and other trade policy matters. Over the last decade, we have worked diligently to diversify our global supply chain. Based on estimates using recent purchase data, we believe over 50% of product purchases for the substantial majority of our U.S. operations are currently sourced in the U.S. We intend to continue diversifying our global supply chain, including further limiting our concentration of product purchases for the substantial majority of our U.S. operations within any single country outside the U.S. We believe these actions, along with our scale, vendor relationships, and experienced internal teams, position us to effectively mitigate the impact that tariffs in effect as of the date of this filing could have on our business, as well as allow for maximum flexibility as our global sourcing strategies evolve.\nTEXT: While tariff and other trade policy developments since the beginning of fiscal 2025 have not had a meaningful financial impact on our business to date, trade policy discussions are ongoing. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty their ultimate impact on our business in future periods, including our results of operations and cash flows. For more information on these risks and uncertainties see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of our 2024 Form 10-K.\nTITLE: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTEXT: The following table presents the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings.\nTITLE: FISCAL 2025 AND FISCAL 2024 THREE MONTH COMPARISONS\nTEXT: Three Months EndedMay 4, 2025April 28, 2024dollars in millions$% of Net Sales$% of Net SalesNet sales$39,856 $36,418 Gross profit13,459 33.8 %12,433 34.1 %Operating expenses:Selling, general and administrative7,530 18.9 6,667 18.3 Depreciation and amortization796 2.0 687 1.9 Total operating expenses8,326 20.9 7,354 20.2 Operating income5,133 12.9 5,079 13.9 Interest and other (income) expense:Interest income and other, net(24)(0.1)(57)(0.2)Interest expense615 1.5 485 1.3 Interest and other, net591 1.5 428 1.2 Earnings before provision for income taxes4,542 11.4 4,651 12.8 Provision for income taxes1,109 2.8 1,051 2.9 Net earnings$3,433 8.6 %$3,600 9.9 %\nTABLE: TABLE: May 4, 2025 April 28, 2024; dollars in millions $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales; Net sales $ 39,856 $ 36,418; Gross profit 13,459 33.8 % 12,433 34.1 %; Selling, general and administrative 7,530 18.9 6,667 18.3; Depreciation and amortization 796 2.0 687 1.9; Total operating expenses 8,326 20.9 7,354 20.2; Operating income 5,133 12.9 5,079 13.9; Interest income and other, net (24) (0.1) (57) (0.2); Interest expense 615 1.5 485 1.3; Interest and other, net 591 1.5 428 1.2; Earnings before provision for income taxes 4,542 11.4 4,651 12.8; Provision for income taxes 1,109 2.8 1,051 2.9; Net earnings $ 3,433 8.6 % $ 3,600 9.9 %.\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: May 4, 2025April 28, 2024\nTITLE: May 4, 2025\nTITLE: April 28, 2024\nTITLE: dollars in millions$% of Net Sales$% of Net Sales\nTITLE: dollars in millions\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: % of Net Sales\nTITLE: % of\nTITLE: Net Sales\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: % of Net Sales\nTITLE: % of\n"

In fiscal 2025, there is a one-week calendar shift as a result of the 53rd week in fiscal 2024. For purposes of the following discussion, comparable sales, comparable customer transactions, and comparable average ticket are based upon the comparable 13-week period from fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Net Sales. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 were $39.9 billion, an increase of 9.4% from $36.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by SRS, which was acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and contributed $2.6 billion of net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Additionally, due to the 53rd week in fiscal 2024, the first quarter of fiscal 2025 included one less week of winter and one additional week of spring, which further contributed to the increase in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: Online sales, which consist of sales of products generated through websites and mobile applications, represented 15.5% of net sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and increased by 10.9% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which includes the benefit of the seasonal timing shift. Calculated on a comparable week basis relative to fiscal 2024, online sales increased by 8.3%.\nTEXT: A stronger U.S. dollar compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 negatively impacted net sales by $275 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Fiscal 2025 includes 52 weeks and fiscal 2024 included 53 weeks. For our calculation of comparable sales in fiscal 2025, we will compare weeks 1 through 52 in fiscal 2025 against weeks 2 through 53 in fiscal 2024. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nTEXT: Total comparable sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 decreased 0.3%, primarily reflecting a 0.5% decrease in comparable customer transactions and a flat comparable average ticket compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Foreign exchange rates negatively impacted comparable sales by approximately 70 basis points for the quarter. Our comparable sales performance continues to reflect the impact of macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand.\nTEXT: During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our Appliances, Plumbing, Indoor Garden, Electrical, Outdoor Garden and Building Materials merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. All of our other merchandising departments posted negative comparable sales during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Gross Profit\nTEXT: Gross profit for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 8.3% to $13.5 billion from $12.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.8% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 34.1% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in gross profit margin primarily reflects the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results, partially offset by lower shrink and supply chain productivity within our Primary segment.\n"

SG&A for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $863 million, or 12.9%, to $7.5 billion from $6.7 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 18.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 18.3% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of a non-recurring legal-related benefit recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as well as higher payroll costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 within our Primary segment.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $109 million, or 15.9%, to $796 million from $687 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 2.0% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.9% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense related to SRS.\nTITLE: Interest and Other, net\nTEXT: Interest and other, net for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 increased $163 million, or 38.1%, to $591 million from $428 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 1.2% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily reflecting higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt.\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 22.6% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in our effective tax rate was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTITLE: Diluted Earnings per Share\nTEXT: Diluted earnings per share were $3.45 for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $3.63 for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in diluted earnings per share was primarily driven by lower net earnings during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nTITLE: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTEXT: To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nTITLE: Return on Invested Capital\nTEXT: We believe ROIC is meaningful for management, investors and ratings agencies because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. ROIC is a non-GAAP profitability measure, not a measure of financial performance under GAAP. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\nTEXT: The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure):\nTEXT: Twelve Months Ended (3)dollars in millionsMay 4, 2025 (2)April 28,2024Net earnings$14,639 $14,870 Interest and other, net2,283 1,752 Provision for income taxes4,658 4,595 Operating income21,580 21,217 Income tax adjustment (1)(5,151)(5,021)NOPAT$16,429 $16,196 Average debt and equity$52,413 $43,629 ROIC31.3 %37.1 %\nTABLE: TABLE: dollars in millions May 4, 2025 (2) April 28,2024; Net earnings $ 14,639 $ 14,870; Interest and other, net 2,283 1,752; Provision for income taxes 4,658 4,595; Operating income 21,580 21,217; Income tax adjustment (1) (5,151) (5,021); NOPAT $ 16,429 $ 16,196; Average debt and equity $ 52,413 $ 43,629; ROIC 31.3 % 37.1 %.\nTITLE: Twelve Months Ended (3)\nTITLE: dollars in millionsMay 4, 2025 (2)April 28,2024\nTITLE: dollars in millions\nTITLE: May 4, 2025 (2)\nTITLE: May 4,\nTITLE: 2025 (2)\nTITLE: April 28,2024\nTEXT: (1)Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.\nTEXT: (2)The twelve months ended May 4, 2025 include operating results for SRS since the acquisition date of June 18, 2024, consistent with our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: (3)The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 includes 14 weeks.

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in connection with the acquisition of SRS and do not have plans to resume share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\nTEXT: During the first three months of fiscal 2025, we invested approximately $806 million back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. In line with our expectation of approximately 2.5% of fiscal 2025 net sales, we plan to invest approximately $4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures in fiscal 2025. We expect to make these investments across initiatives to improve the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities, to continue to mature and build out Pro customer capabilities, as well as to build new stores. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. We may also utilize strategic acquisitions to help accelerate our strategic initiatives.\nTEXT: In February 2025, we announced a 2.2% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.25 to $2.30 per share. During the first three months of fiscal 2025, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of May 4, 2025, approximately $11.7 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available.\nTITLE: DEBT\nTEXT: We have a commercial paper program that allows for borrowings up to $7.0 billion and is supported by $7.0 billion of back-up credit facilities. At the beginning of fiscal 2025, these back-up credit facilities consisted of a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027, a 364-day $2.0 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2025, and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2025. On May 6, 2025, we terminated all three back-up credit facility agreements and simultaneously entered into a new five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2030 and a new 364-day $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in May 2026.\nTEXT: All of our short-term borrowings in the first three months of fiscal 2025 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $1.1 billion. At May 4, 2025, we had $38 million of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program with a weighted average interest rate of 2.9%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our back-up credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nTEXT: We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. We did not have any issuances of senior notes during the first three months of fiscal 2025. In April 2025, we repaid our $500 million 2.70% and $500 million 5.125% senior notes at maturity.\nTEXT: The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. We were in compliance with all such covenants at May 4, 2025. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nTITLE: CASH FLOWS SUMMARY\n"

Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.2 billion in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024, primarily due to changes in working capital.
