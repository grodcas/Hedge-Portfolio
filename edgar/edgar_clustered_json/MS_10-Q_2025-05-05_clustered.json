During the current quarter, as a result of a March employee action, we recognized severance costs associated with a reduction in force (“RIF”) of $144 million, included in Compensation and benefits expenses. The RIF occurred across our business segments and geographic regions and impacted approximately 2% of our global workforce at that time. The RIF was related to performance management and the alignment of our workforce to our business needs, rather than a change in strategy or exit of businesses. We recorded severance costs of $78 million in the Institutional Securities business segment, $50 million in the Wealth Management business segment, and $16 million in the Investment Management business segment for the current quarter.

Geopolitical risks, inflation, as well as the timing and pace of central bank actions related to interest rates present ongoing risks to the economic environment and growth. These factors have impacted, and could continue to impact capital markets and our businesses, as discussed further in “Business Segments” herein.For more information on economic and market conditions, and the potential effects of geopolitical events and acts of war or aggression on our future results, refer to “Risk Factors” and “Forward-Looking Statements” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From time to time, we may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial measures” in this document or in the course of our earnings releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial presentations, definitive proxy statements and other public disclosures. A “non-GAAP financial measure” excludes, or includes, amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing or comparing our financial condition, operating results and capital adequacy.These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure. We present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on DCP investments from net revenues and compensation expenses. The impact of DCP is primarily reflected in our Wealth Management business segment results. These measures allow for better comparability of period-to-period underlying operating performance and revenue trends, especially in our Wealth Management business segment. By excluding the impact of these items, we are better able to describe the business drivers and resulting impact to net revenues and corresponding change to the associated compensation expenses. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Other Matters” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity. The calculation of tangible common equity represents common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction.

We actively manage the amount of our Liquidity Resources considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk appetite and is calibrated to meet various internal and regulatory requirements and to fund prospective business activities. The Liquidity Resources are primarily held within the Parent Company and its major operating subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately following are different from Eligible HQLA, which, in accordance with the LCR rule, also takes into account certain regulatory weightings and other operational considerations.

Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded.

See Note 6 to the financial statements for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such contingent features.While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it would have on our business and results of operations in future periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the rating assigned by the relevant agency before the downgrade, individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.

Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Securities financing transactions, Derivatives exposures, Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations, and growth in lending.

Our next resolution plan submission is due in July 2025.As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy, which would impose losses on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning,” “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Regulatory Developments and Other MattersProposed Changes to Capital RequirementsOn April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks applicable to us, aimed at reducing the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test results. Under the proposal, our SCB would be based, in part, on the average of the post-stress capital decline embedded in the Federal Reserve’s stress test results over two consecutive years. Additionally, the proposal would shift the annual effective date of the revised SCB from October 1 to January 1 of the following year and modify certain elements of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program.\n"

Our next resolution plan submission is due in July 2025.As described in our most recent resolution plan, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE strategy, which would impose losses on the holders of eligible LTD and other forms of eligible TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on creditors of our supported entities and without requiring taxpayer or government financial support.For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, including the implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—Resolution and Recovery Planning,” “Risk Factors—Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Resolution and Recovery Planning” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Regulatory Developments and Other MattersProposed Changes to Capital RequirementsOn April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks applicable to us, aimed at reducing the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test results. Under the proposal, our SCB would be based, in part, on the average of the post-stress capital decline embedded in the Federal Reserve’s stress test results over two consecutive years. Additionally, the proposal would shift the annual effective date of the revised SCB from October 1 to January 1 of the following year and modify certain elements of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program.\nTITLE: Resolution and Recovery Planning\nTEXT: We are required to submit once every two years to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC (“Agencies”) a resolution plan that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.

For a discussion of our Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management functions, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Risk Management” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Market RiskMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, spreads, indices, volatilities, correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments. The Wealth Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk (including interest rate risk) from lending and deposit-taking activities. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading market risk from capital investments in its funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market Risk” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Trading RisksWe have exposures to a wide range of risks related to interest rates and credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices as well as the associated implied volatilities, correlations and spreads of the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities. The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios.For information regarding our primary risk exposures and market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and limitations, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market Risk—Trading Risks” in the 2024 Form 10-K.95%/One-Day Management VaR for the Trading Portfolio Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2025$ in millionsPeriod EndAverageHigh1Low1Interest rate and credit spread$25 $30 $39 $22 Equity price23 23 26 19 Foreign exchange rate9 11 15 7 Commodity price22 17 27 12 Less: Diversification benefit2(40)(35)N/AN/APrimary Risk Categories$39 $46 $54 $39 Credit Portfolio18 19 23 18 Less: Diversification benefit2(11)(15)N/AN/ATotal Management VaR$46 $50 $60 $43 Three Months EndedDecember 31, 2024$ in millionsPeriod EndAverageHigh1Low1Interest rate and credit spread$23 $28 $43 $19 Equity price21 24 39 18 Foreign exchange rate10 9 13 6 Commodity price18 15 20 11 Less: Diversification benefit2(37)(36)N/AN/APrimary Risk Categories$35 $40 $59 $32 Credit Portfolio20 21 23 20 Less: Diversification benefit2(16)(15)N/AN/ATotal Management VaR$39 $46 $64 $39 1.The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure. 2.Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs.
