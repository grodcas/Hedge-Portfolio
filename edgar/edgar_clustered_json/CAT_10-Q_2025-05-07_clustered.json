Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows for the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate, commodity price and certain deferred compensation plan liability exposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used for speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts, interest rate contracts, commodity forward and option contracts and total return swap contracts. Our derivative activities are subject to the management, direction and control of our senior financial officers. We present at least annually to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on our risk management practices, including our use of financial derivative instruments.\nTEXT: We recognize all derivatives at their fair value on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. On the date the derivative contract is entered into, we designate the derivative as (1) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge), (2) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flow (cash flow hedge) or (3) an undesignated instrument. We record in current earnings changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged recognized asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. For foreign exchange contracts designated as fair value hedges, the interim settlements are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument within Interest expense. We record in AOCI changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated and highly effective as a cash flow hedge, to the extent effective, on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position until we reclassify them to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. We report changes in the fair value of undesignated derivative instruments in current earnings. We classify cash flows from designated derivative financial instruments within the same category as the item being hedged on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow. We include cash flows from undesignated derivative financial instruments in the investing category on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow.\nTEXT: We formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and linking cash flow hedges to specific forecasted transactions or variability of cash flow.\nTEXT: We also formally assess, both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the designated derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flow of hedged items. When a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge or the underlying hedged transaction is no longer probable, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, in accordance with the derecognition criteria for hedge accounting.\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate risk\nTEXT: Foreign currency exchange rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the U.S. dollar value of sales made and costs incurred in foreign currencies. Movements in foreign currency rates also affect our competitive position as these changes may affect business practices and/or pricing strategies of non-U.S.-based competitors. Additionally, we have balance sheet positions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby creating exposure to movements in exchange rates.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase, manufacture and sell products in many locations around the world. As we have a diversified revenue and cost base, we manage our future foreign currency cash flow exposure on a net basis. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage unmatched foreign currency cash inflow and outflow. Our objective is to minimize the risk of exchange rate movements that would reduce the U.S. dollar value of our foreign currency cash flow. Our policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to approximately five years. As of March 31, 2025, the maximum term of these outstanding contracts at inception was approximately 60 months.\nTEXT: We generally designate as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract any foreign currency forward or option contracts that meet the requirements for hedge accounting and the maturity extends beyond the current quarter-end. We perform designation on a specific exposure basis to support hedge accounting. The remainder of ME&T foreign currency contracts are undesignated.\n"

Our policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts to offset the risk of currency mismatch between our assets and liabilities and exchange rate risk associated with future transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency forward and option contracts are primarily undesignated. We designate fixed-to-fixed cross currency contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on foreign currency fixed-rate assets and liabilities. We designate float-to-float cross currency contracts as fair value hedges to protect against movements in exchange rates on floating-rate assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Interest rate movements create a degree of risk by affecting the amount of our interest payments and the value of our fixed-rate debt. Our practice is to use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations generally use fixed-rate debt as a source of funding. Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds. Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Financial Products operations has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move.\nTEXT: Our policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate.\nTEXT: We have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products. We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts at the time of liquidation into earnings over the remaining term of the previously designated hedged item.\nTEXT: Commodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials.\nTEXT: Our ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased for operational use.\nTEXT: Our objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity forward and option contracts are undesignated.\nTEXT: Deferred compensation plan liability risk\nTEXT: We are also exposed to variability in compensation expense related to certain non-qualified deferred compensation obligations to employees.

The maximum potential amount of future payments (undiscounted and without reduction for any amounts possibly recoverable) that we could be required to make under the guarantees was $390 million and $368 million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nTEXT: We have dealer performance guarantees and third-party performance guarantees that do not limit potential payment to end users related to indemnities and other commercial contractual obligations. In addition, we have entered into contracts involving industry standard indemnifications that do not limit potential payment. For these unlimited guarantees, we are unable to estimate a maximum potential amount of future payments that could result from claims made.\nTEXT: No significant loss has been experienced or is anticipated under any of these guarantees.\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides guarantees to purchase certain loans of Caterpillar dealers from a special-purpose corporation (SPC) that qualifies as a variable interest entity. Cat Financial receives a fee for providing this guarantee. The purpose of the SPC is to provide short-term working capital loans to Caterpillar dealers. This SPC issues commercial paper and uses the proceeds to fund its loan program. Cat Financial is the primary beneficiary of the SPC as its guarantees result in Cat Financial having both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the SPC’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses, and therefore Cat Financial has consolidated the financial statements of the SPC. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the SPC’s assets of $1.01 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of loans to dealers, and the SPC’s liabilities of $1.01 billion and $1.14 billion, respectively, were primarily comprised of commercial paper. The assets of the SPC are not available to pay Cat Financial’s creditors. Cat Financial may be obligated to perform under the guarantee if the SPC experiences losses. No loss has been experienced or is anticipated under this loan purchase agreement.\nTEXT: We determine our product warranty liability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current field population and dealer inventory.

We made these purchases through the combination of accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with third-party financial institutions and open market transactions in 2025 and 2024.\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025, we entered into ASR agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $3.0 billion of common stock. We advanced the $3.0 billion and received approximately 5.7 million shares of Caterpillar common stock, approximately 70% of the estimated final number of shares to be repurchased, with a value of $2.1 billion. The final number of shares to ultimately be repurchased will be based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of the ASR agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements. The final settlement of the ASR agreements is scheduled to occur during the fourth quarter of 2025.

In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to internal combustion engines. We have made, and will continue to make, significant research and development and capital expenditures to comply with these emissions standards.\nTEXT: We are engaged in remedial activities at a number of locations, often with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. When it is probable we will pay remedial costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue the investigation, remediation, and operating and maintenance costs against our earnings. We accrue costs based on consideration of currently available data and information with respect to each individual site, including available technologies, current applicable laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, we accrue the minimum. Where multiple potentially responsible parties are involved, we consider our proportionate share of the probable costs. In formulating the estimate of probable costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies or others. We reassess these accrued amounts on a quarterly basis. The amount recorded for environmental remediation is not material and is included in Accrued expenses. We believe there is no more than a remote chance that a material amount for remedial activities at any individual site, or at all the sites in the aggregate, will be required.\nTEXT: In addition, we are involved in other unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business. The most prevalent of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes) and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTEXT: Our operations in Brazil are subject to highly complex labor, tax, customs and other laws. While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws, we are periodically engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws, including certain tax and customs disputes with federal, state and municipal authorities in Brazil relating to export activities associated with Caterpillar Brasil Ltda. The Company is unable to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate any potential losses; however, we currently believe that any matters raised will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nTITLE: 15. Income taxes\nTITLE: Income taxes\nTEXT: The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025 was 22.3 percent compared to 19.5 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was favorably impacted by nontaxable gains from a divestiture of a non-US mining entity.\nTITLE: 16. Segment information\nTITLE: Segment information\nTITLE: A. Basis for segment information\nTEXT: Our Executive Office is comprised of a Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Operating Officer (COO), four Group Presidents, a Chief Financial Officer (CFO), a Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel and a Chief Human Resources Officer. The COO, Group Presidents and CFO are accountable for a related set of end-to-end businesses that they manage. The Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel leads the Law, Security and Public Policy Division. The Chief Human Resources Officer leads the Human Resources Organization. The CEO allocates resources and manages performance at the COO/Group President/CFO level. As such, the CEO serves as our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), and operating segments are primarily based on the COO/Group President/CFO reporting structure.\nTEXT: Three of our operating segments, Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation are led by Group Presidents. One operating segment, Financial Products, is led by the CFO who also has responsibility for Corporate Services. Corporate Services is a cost center primarily responsible for the performance of certain support functions globally and to provide centralized services; it does not meet the definition of an operating segment. One Group President leads one smaller operating segment that is included in the All Other Segment. The Law, Security and Public Policy Division and the Human Resources Organization are cost centers and do not meet the definition of an operating segment.\n"

Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.\nTEXT: Resource Industries: A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in mining, heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Responsibilities include business strategy, product design, product management and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product portfolio includes large track-type tractors; large mining trucks; hard rock vehicles; electric rope shovels; draglines; hydraulic shovels; rotary drills; large wheel loaders; off-highway trucks; articulated trucks; wheel tractor scrapers; wheel dozers; landfill compactors; soil compactors; wide-body trucks; select work tools; machinery components; electronics and control systems and related parts. In addition to equipment, Resource Industries also develops and sells technology products and services to provide customers fleet management, equipment management analytics, autonomous machine capabilities, safety services and mining performance solutions. Resource Industries also manages areas that provide services to other parts of the company, including strategic procurement, lean center of excellence, integrated manufacturing, research and development for hydraulic systems, automation, electronics and software for Caterpillar machines and engines. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.\nTEXT: Energy & Transportation: A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using reciprocating engines, turbines, diesel-electric locomotives and related services across industries serving Oil and Gas, Power Generation, Industrial and Transportation applications, including marine- and rail-related businesses as well as product support of on-highway engines.

Responsibilities also include the remanufacturing of Caterpillar reciprocating engines and components and remanufacturing services for other companies. Inter-segment sales are a source of revenue for this segment.\nTEXT: Financial Products Segment: Provides financing alternatives to customers and dealers around the world for Caterpillar products and services, as well as financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. Financing plans include operating and finance leases, revolving charge accounts, installment sale contracts, repair/rebuild financing, working capital loans and wholesale financing plans. The segment also provides insurance and risk management products and services that help customers and dealers manage their business risk. Insurance and risk management products offered include physical damage insurance, inventory protection plans, extended service coverage and maintenance plans for machines and engines, and dealer property and casualty insurance. The various forms of financing, insurance and risk management products offered to customers and dealers help support the purchase and lease of Caterpillar equipment. The segment also earns revenues from Machinery, Energy & Transportation, but the related costs are not allocated to operating segments. Financial Products’ segment profit is determined on a pretax basis and includes other income/expense items.\nTEXT: All Other Segment: Primarily includes activities such as: business strategy; product management and development; manufacturing and sourcing of wear and maintenance components primarily for Cat® products; parts distribution; integrated logistics solutions; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration, including a wholly owned dealer in Japan; dealer portfolio management and ensuring the most efficient and effective distribution of machines, engines and parts; brand management and marketing strategy; and digital investments for new customer and dealer solutions that integrate data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience.

Segment measurement and reconciliations\nTEXT: We determine the segment profit of Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment on a pretax basis and exclude most interest expense and certain other income (expense) items. We determine Financial Products Segment profit on a pretax basis and include other income (expense) items.\nTEXT: Our CODM evaluates the operating performance of the segments using segment profit as it provides insight into the financial health of each segment. The CODM reviews this metric regularly to compare the profitability of segments, identify trends, and evaluate which segments require additional resources or strategic adjustments. The CODM uses segment profit to support the allocation of resources predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process. Additionally, the CODM monitors forecast-to-actual variances, focusing on areas where performance deviates from expectations, when evaluating the performance of each segment and making decisions about allocating capital and other resources to each segment.\nTEXT: There are several methodology differences between our segment reporting and our external reporting. The following is a list of the more significant methodology differences:\nTEXT: •For Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation and our All Other Segment net assets generally include inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangibles, accounts payable and customer advances. We generally manage at the corporate level liabilities other than accounts payable and customer advances, and we do not include these in segment operations. Financial Products Segment assets generally include all categories of assets.\nTEXT: •We value segment inventories and cost of sales using a current cost methodology.\nTEXT: •We amortize goodwill allocated to segments using a fixed amount based on a 20-year useful life. This methodology difference only impacts segment assets. We do not include goodwill amortization expense in segment profit. In addition, we have allocated to segments only a portion of goodwill for certain acquisitions made in 2011 or later.\nTEXT: •We generally manage currency exposures for operating segments, other than Financial Products, at the corporate level and do not include in segment profit or segment assets the effects of changes in exchange rates on results of operations and financial position within the year. We report the net difference created in the translation of revenues and costs between exchange rates used for U.S. GAAP reporting and exchange rates used for segment reporting as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: •We do not include stock-based compensation expense in segment profit.\nTEXT: •Postretirement benefit expenses are split; segments are generally responsible for service costs, with the remaining elements of net periodic benefit cost included as a methodology difference.\nTEXT: Reconciling items are created based on accounting differences between segment reporting and our consolidated external reporting. Please refer to pages 29 to 30 for financial information regarding significant reconciling items. Most of our reconciling items are self-explanatory given the above explanations. For the reconciliation of profit, we have grouped the reconciling items as follows:\nTEXT: •Corporate costs: These costs are related to corporate requirements primarily for compliance and legal functions for the benefit of the entire organization.\nTEXT: •Restructuring income/costs: May include costs for employee separation, long-lived asset impairments, contract terminations and (gains)/losses on divestitures. These costs are included in Other operating (income) expenses except for defined-benefit plan curtailment losses and special termination benefits, which are included in Other income (expense). Restructuring costs also include other exit-related costs, which may consist of accelerated depreciation, inventory write-downs, building demolition, equipment relocation and project management costs and LIFO inventory decrement benefits from inventory liquidations at closed facilities, all of which are primarily included in Cost of goods sold. See Note 20 for more information.\nTEXT: •Methodology differences: See previous discussion of significant accounting differences between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting.\nTEXT: •Timing: Timing differences in the recognition of costs between segment reporting and consolidated external reporting. For example, we report certain costs on the cash basis for segment reporting and the accrual basis for consolidated external reporting.\n"

Cat Financial financing activities\nTITLE: Cat Financial financing activities\nTITLE: Allowance for credit losses\nTITLE: Portfolio segments\nTEXT: A portfolio segment is the level at which Cat Financial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Cat Financial's portfolio segments and related methods for estimating expected credit losses are as follows:\nTITLE: Customer\nTEXT: Cat Financial provides loans and finance leases to end-user customers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used Caterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use. Cat Financial also provides financing for power generation facilities that, in most cases, incorporate Caterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial's customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 51 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of March 31, 2025.\nTEXT: Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\nTEXT: During the three months ended March 31, 2025, Cat Financial's forecasts reflected a continuation of the trend of historically low unemployment rates as well as global market uncertainty and continued actions by global central banks aimed at reducing inflation. Cat Financial believes the economic forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\n"

Cat Financial's wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured retail loans to Caterpillar dealers.\nTEXT: Cat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nTEXT: In general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the three months ended March 31, 2025.\nTITLE: Classes of finance receivables\nTEXT: Cat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\nTITLE: •North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\nTITLE: •EAME - Finance receivables originated in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Eurasia.\nTITLE: •Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\nTITLE: •Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.\nTITLE: •Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.\nTEXT: •Power - Finance receivables originated worldwide to large power customers related to Caterpillar electrical power generation, gas compression and co-generation systems and non-Caterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.\nTEXT: Receivable balances, including accrued interest, are written off against the allowance for credit losses when, in the judgment of management, they are considered uncollectible (generally upon repossession of the collateral). Generally, the amount of the write-off is determined by comparing the fair value of the collateral, less cost to sell, to the amortized cost of the receivable. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for credit losses when received.\nTEXT: An analysis of the allowance for credit losses was as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)Three Months Ended March 31, 2025Three Months Ended March 31, 2024CustomerDealerTotalCustomerDealerTotalBeginning balance$258 $4 $262 $276 $51 $327 Write-offs(30)— (30)(23)(47)(70)Recoveries10 — 10 15 — 15 Provision for credit losses 133 — 33 9 — 9 Other2 — 2 (4)— (4)Ending balance$273 $4 $277 $273 $4 $277 Finance Receivables$21,964 $1,377 $23,341 $20,413 $1,794 $22,207 1 Excludes provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and other miscellaneous receivables.\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024; Customer Dealer Total Customer Dealer Total; Beginning balance $ 258 $ 4 $ 262 $ 276 $ 51 $ 327; Write-offs (30) — (30) (23) (47) (70); Recoveries 10 — 10 15 — 15; Provision for credit losses 1 33 — 33 9 — 9; Other 2 — 2 (4) — (4); Ending balance $ 273 $ 4 $ 277 $ 273 $ 4 $ 277; Finance Receivables $ 21,964 $ 1,377 $ 23,341 $ 20,413 $ 1,794 $ 22,207.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Three Months Ended March 31, 2025Three Months Ended March 31, 2024\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Three Months Ended March 31, 2025\nTITLE: CustomerDealerTotalCustomerDealerTotal\nTITLE: Customer\nTITLE: Dealer\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Beginning balance$258 $4 $262 $276 $51 $327\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 258\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 262\nTITLE: Write-offs(30)— (30)(23)(47)(70)\nTITLE: (30)\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: (30)\nTITLE: Recoveries10 — 10 15 — 15\nTITLE: 10\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 10\nTITLE: Provision for credit losses 133 — 33 9 — 9\nTITLE: 33\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 33\nTITLE: Other2 — 2 (4)— (4)\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: Ending balance$273 $4 $277 $273 $4 $277\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 273\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 277\nTITLE: Finance Receivables$21,964 $1,377 $23,341 $20,413 $1,794 $22,207\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 21,964\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,377\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 23,341\nTEXT: 1 Excludes provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments and other miscellaneous receivables.\nTEXT: Gross write-offs by origination year for the Customer portfolio segment were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)Three Months Ended March 31, 202520252024202320222021PriorRevolving Finance ReceivablesTotalNorth America$— $2 $5 $4 $2 $1 $2 $16 EAME— 1 1 1 — — — 3 Asia/Pacific— — 1 — 1 — — 2 Latin America— — 1 1 — 1 — 3 Mining— 3 1 1 — — — 5 Power— — — — — 1 — 1 Total$— $6 $9 $7 $3 $3 $2 $30 Three Months Ended March 31, 202420242023202220212020PriorRevolving Finance ReceivablesTotalNorth America$— $3 $4 $2 $1 $— $3 $13 EAME— 1 1 1 — — — 3 Asia/Pacific— 1 2 1 1 — — 5 Latin America— — 1 1 — — — 2 Total$— $5 $8 $5 $2 $— $3 $23\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Three Months Ended March 31, 2025; 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 Prior Revolving Finance Receivables Total; North America $ — $ 2 $ 5 $ 4 $ 2 $ 1 $ 2 $ 16; EAME — 1 1 1 — — — 3; Asia/Pacific — — 1 — 1 — — 2; Latin America — — 1 1 — 1 — 3; Mining — 3 1 1 — — — 5; Power — — — — — 1 — 1; Total $ — $ 6 $ 9 $ 7 $ 3 $ 3 $ 2 $ 30; 2024 2023 2022 2021 2020 Prior Revolving Finance Receivables Total; North America $ — $ 3 $ 4 $ 2 $ 1 $ — $ 3 $ 13; EAME — 1 1 1 — — — 3; Asia/Pacific — 1 2 1 1 — — 5; Latin America — — 1 1 — — — 2; Total $ — $ 5 $ 8 $ 5 $ 2 $ — $ 3 $ 23.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Three Months Ended March 31, 2025\n"

On an ongoing basis, Cat Financial monitors credit quality based on past-due status as there is a meaningful correlation between the past-due status of customers and the risk of loss. In determining past-due status, Cat Financial considers the entire finance receivable past due when any installment is over 30 days past due.\nTITLE: Customer\nTEXT: The aging category of Cat Financial's amortized cost of finance receivables in the Customer portfolio segment by origination year were as follows:\nTEXT: (Millions of dollars)March 31, 202520252024202320222021PriorRevolving Finance Receivables Total Finance ReceivablesNorth America Current$1,359 $4,932 $2,741 $1,347 $787 $181 $394 $11,741 31-60 days past due4 37 38 29 14 4 3 129 61-90 days past due— 18 14 6 5 2 1 46 91+ days past due— 14 41 26 14 7 1 103 EAMECurrent323 1,188 817 479 246 128 — 3,181 31-60 days past due— 8 8 7 4 1 — 28 61-90 days past due— 6 8 5 1 — — 20 91+ days past due— 4 14 6 6 4 — 34 Asia/PacificCurrent258 802 464 205 65 11 1 1,806 31-60 days past due— 8 5 3 2 — — 18 61-90 days past due— 1 1 3 — — — 5 91+ days past due— 2 2 2 1 — — 7 Latin AmericaCurrent260 738 332 190 46 7 — 1,573 31-60 days past due— 10 7 4 1 2 — 24 61-90 days past due— 3 2 2 1 — — 8 91+ days past due— 4 6 7 3 1 — 21 MiningCurrent184 861 699 396 174 80 23 2,417 31-60 days past due— 2 — — — 2 — 4 61-90 days past due— — — — — — — — 91+ days past due— 4 7 5 — 4 — 20 PowerCurrent31 207 185 39 37 108 171 778 31-60 days past due— — — — — — — — 61-90 days past due— — — — — — — — 91+ days past due— — — — — 1 — 1 Totals by Aging CategoryCurrent$2,415 $8,728 $5,238 $2,656 $1,355 $515 $589 $21,496 31-60 days past due4 65 58 43 21 9 3 203 61-90 days past due— 28 25 16 7 2 1 79 91+ days past due— 28 70 46 24 17 1 186 Total Customer$2,419 $8,849 $5,391 $2,761 $1,407 $543 $594 $21,964\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) March 31, 2025; 2025 2024 2023 2022 2021 Prior Revolving Finance Receivables Total Finance Receivables; Current $ 1,359 $ 4,932 $ 2,741 $ 1,347 $ 787 $ 181 $ 394 $ 11,741; 31-60 days past due 4 37 38 29 14 4 3 129; 61-90 days past due — 18 14 6 5 2 1 46; 91+ days past due — 14 41 26 14 7 1 103; Current 323 1,188 817 479 246 128 — 3,181; 31-60 days past due — 8 8 7 4 1 — 28; 61-90 days past due — 6 8 5 1 — — 20; 91+ days past due — 4 14 6 6 4 — 34; Current 258 802 464 205 65 11 1 1,806; 31-60 days past due — 8 5 3 2 — — 18; 61-90 days past due — 1 1 3 — — — 5; 91+ days past due — 2 2 2 1 — — 7; Current 260 738 332 190 46 7 — 1,573; 31-60 days past due — 10 7 4 1 2 — 24; 61-90 days past due — 3 2 2 1 — — 8; 91+ days past due — 4 6 7 3 1 — 21; Current 184 861 699 396 174 80 23 2,417; 31-60 days past due — 2 — — — 2 — 4; 61-90 days past due — — — — — — — —; 91+ days past due — 4 7 5 — 4 — 20; Current 31 207 185 39 37 108 171 778; 31-60 days past due — — — — — — — —; 61-90 days past due — — — — — — — —; 91+ days past due — — — — — 1 — 1; Current $ 2,415 $ 8,728 $ 5,238 $ 2,656 $ 1,355 $ 515 $ 589 $ 21,496; 31-60 days past due 4 65 58 43 21 9 3 203; 61-90 days past due — 28 25 16 7 2 1 79; 91+ days past due — 28 70 46 24 17 1 186; Total Customer $ 2,419 $ 8,849 $ 5,391 $ 2,761 $ 1,407 $ 543 $ 594 $ 21,964.\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)March 31, 2025\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: March 31, 2025\nTITLE: 20252024202320222021PriorRevolving Finance Receivables Total Finance Receivables\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\nTITLE: Prior\nTITLE: Revolving Finance Receivables\nTITLE: Total Finance Receivables\nTITLE: North America\nTITLE: Current$1,359 $4,932 $2,741 $1,347 $787 $181 $394 $11,741\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,359\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 4,932\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 2,741\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 1,347\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 787\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 181\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 394\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 11,741\nTITLE: 31-60 days past due4 37 38 29 14 4 3 129\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: 37\nTITLE: 38\nTITLE: 29\nTITLE: 14\nTITLE: 4\nTITLE: 3\nTITLE: 129\nTITLE: 61-90 days past due— 18 14 6 5 2 1 46\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 18\nTITLE: 14\nTITLE: 6\nTITLE: 5\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: 46\nTITLE: 91+ days past due— 14 41 26 14 7 1 103\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 14\nTITLE: 41\nTITLE: 26\nTITLE: 14\nTITLE: 7\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: 103\nTITLE: EAME\nTITLE: Current323 1,188 817 479 246 128 — 3,181\nTITLE: 323\nTITLE: 1,188\nTITLE: 817\nTITLE: 479\nTITLE: 246\nTITLE: 128\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: 3,181\n"

Typically, the types of modifications granted are payment deferrals, interest-only payment periods and/or term extensions. Many modifications Cat Financial grants are for commercial reasons or for borrowers experiencing some form of short-term financial stress and may result in insignificant payment delays. Cat Financial does not consider these borrowers to be experiencing financial difficulty. Modifications for borrowers Cat Financial does consider to be experiencing financial difficulty typically result in payment deferrals and/or reduced payments for a period of four months or longer, term extension of six months or longer or a combination of both.\nTEXT: During the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, there were no finance receivable modifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment. The amortized cost basis of finance receivables modified for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the Customer portfolio segment during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, was $6 million and $3 million, respectively. Total modifications with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty represented 0.03 percent and 0.01 percent of Cat Financial's Customer portfolio for the same periods, respectively.\nTEXT: The financial effects of term extensions and payment delays for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the three months ended March 31, were as follows:\nTEXT: (In months)20252024Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts710Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods89\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts — 2025: 7; 2024: 10\nTABLE_ROW: Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods — 2025: 8; 2024: 9\nTITLE: (In months)20252024\nTITLE: (In months)\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: Weighted average extension to term of modified contracts710\nTITLE: 7\nTITLE: Weighted average payment deferral and/or interest only periods89\nTITLE: 8\nTEXT: After Cat Financial modifies a finance receivable, they continue to track its performance under its most recent modified terms.

In some cases where market prices are not available, we make use of observable market based inputs to calculate fair value, in which case the measurements are classified within Level 2. If quoted or observable market prices are not available, fair value is based upon valuations in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including internally developed models that use, where possible, current market-based parameters such as interest rates, yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level 3.\nTEXT: We classify fair value measurements according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. We may therefore classify a measurement within Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.\nTEXT: Fair value measurement includes the consideration of nonperformance risk. Nonperformance risk refers to the risk that an obligation (either by a counterparty or Caterpillar) will not be fulfilled. For financial assets traded in an active market (Level 1 and certain Level 2), the nonperformance risk is included in the market price. For certain other financial assets and liabilities (certain Level 2 and Level 3), our fair value calculations have been adjusted accordingly.\nTEXT: Investments in debt and equity securities\nTEXT: We have investments in certain debt and equity securities that are recorded at fair value. Fair values for our U.S. treasury bonds and large capitalization value and smaller company growth equity securities are based upon valuations for identical instruments in active markets. Fair values for other government debt securities, corporate debt securities and mortgage-backed debt securities are based upon models that take into consideration such market-based factors as\nTEXT: recent sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds.\nTEXT: In addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nTEXT: See Note 8 for additional information on our investments in debt and equity securities.\nTEXT: Derivative financial instruments\nTEXT: The fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon interest rates to determine discounted cash flows. The fair value of foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the contract price and the market-based forward rate. The fair value of total return swap contracts is primarily based on valuing the underlying securities or funds using pricing by industry providers and the average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus a spread.\nTEXT: See Note 5 for additional information.\nTEXT: Assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis at fair value included in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 were as follows:\nTEXT: March 31, 2025 (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair ValueAssets Debt securities Government debt securities U.S. treasury bonds$9 $— $— $— $9 Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds— 68 — — 68 Corporate debt securities Corporate bonds and other debt securities— 2,423 — — 2,423 Asset-backed securities— 222 — — 222 Mortgage-backed debt securities U.S. governmental agency— 465 — — 465 Residential— 2 — — 2 Commercial— 127 — — 127 Total debt securities9 3,307 — — 3,316 Equity securities Large capitalization value267 — — — 267 Smaller company growth39 — — — 39 REIT— — — 168 168 Total equity securities306 — — 168 474 Derivative financial instruments - assetsForeign currency contracts - net— 109 — — 109 Commodity contracts - net— 3 — — 3 Total assets$315 $3,419 $— $168 $3,902 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments - liabilitiesInterest rate contracts - net$— $101 $— $— $101 Total return swap contracts - net— 26 — — 26 Total liabilities$— $127 $— $— $127\nTABLE: TABLE: (Millions of dollars) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Measured at NAV TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value; U.S. treasury bonds $ 9 $ — $ — $ — $ 9; Other U.S. and non-U.S. government bonds — 68 — — 68; Corporate bonds and other debt securities — 2,423 — — 2,423; Asset-backed securities — 222 — — 222; U.S. governmental agency — 465 — — 465; Residential — 2 — — 2; Commercial — 127 — — 127; Total debt securities 9 3,307 — — 3,316; Large capitalization value 267 — — — 267; Smaller company growth 39 — — — 39; REIT — — — 168 168; Total equity securities 306 — — 168 474; Foreign currency contracts - net — 109 — — 109; Commodity contracts - net — 3 — — 3; Total assets $ 315 $ 3,419 $ — $ 168 $ 3,902; Interest rate contracts - net $ — $ 101 $ — $ — $ 101; Total return swap contracts - net — 26 — — 26; Total liabilities $ — $ 127 $ — $ — $ 127.\nTITLE: March 31, 2025\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)Level 1Level 2Level 3Measured at NAVTotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\nTITLE: (Millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Measured at NAV\nTITLE: TotalAssets / Liabilities,at Fair Value\n"

A loan is measured at fair value when management determines that collection of contractual amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated. Generally, the fair value of these receivables is measured using the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell.

Construction spend in North America remains at healthy levels, and infrastructure projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) continue to be awarded. In Asia Pacific, outside of China, economic conditions continue to be soft. China has shown positive momentum in the excavator industry above 10-tons, but from a very low level of activity. In EAME, weak economic conditions in Europe remain, while conditions are supportive of investment in Africa and the Middle East. Construction activity in Latin America is expected to moderately decline in 2025 as compared to 2024.\nTEXT: In Resource Industries, we are starting the year with strong order rates and backlog growth, particularly for large mining trucks. Rebuild activity is expected to remain healthy. Although most key commodities remain above investment thresholds, customers continue to display capital discipline. Customer product utilization remains high, the age of the fleet remains\nTEXT: elevated, and we continue to see growing customer acceptance of our autonomous solutions. We believe the evolving energy landscape will support increased commodity demand over time, providing further opportunities for long-term profitable growth.\nTEXT: In Energy & Transportation, the growth in backlog was driven by robust order activity in both Oil and Gas and Power Generation. Demand remains strong in Power Generation for both reciprocating engines and turbines and turbine-related services in 2025. The strength of our backlog gives us confidence in our long-term outlook. For Oil and Gas reciprocating engines and services, we expect continuing softness in well servicing due to ongoing capital discipline by our customers, industry consolidation and efficiency improvements in our customers’ operations. Also within Oil and Gas reciprocating engines and services, we see positive momentum in gas compression. For turbines and turbine-related services used in Oil and Gas applications, backlog remains strong, and we continue to see healthy orders. Demand for products in Industrial applications is expected to remain at a relatively low level. Transportation is expected to remain stable.\nTEXT: Full-Year 2025 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: We are closely monitoring the evolving economic conditions. Due to the tariff announcements and increasing economic uncertainty, we have evaluated a variety of scenarios to estimate the potential impact of tariffs on our results for the remainder of the year.\nTEXT: Demand signals were stronger than we expected in the first quarter of 2025, including backlog growth across our three primary segments and stronger than expected sales of equipment to end users in Construction Industries and Resource Industries. These indicators boost our confidence in the resilience of our sales and revenues this year.\nTEXT: For the full-year 2025, in a pre-tariff scenario, which does not include any impact from tariffs, we expect sales and revenues to be about flat compared to 2024.\nTEXT: In our alternative scenario, which assumes negative economic growth in the second half of 2025, we expect full-year sales and revenues to only be down slightly in 2025 as compared to 2024. This expectation is a reflection of the diversity of our end markets and the strength of our record backlog, especially for large reciprocating engines and for turbines and turbine-related services.\nTEXT: We expect the year over year impact of unfavorable price realization to be greater in the first and second quarters of 2025 and expect it to moderate in the second half of 2025. In addition, we also do not expect a significant decrease in machine dealer inventory as we saw in the fourth quarter of 2024, and we still expect dealers to hold inventories about flat for the full year.\nTEXT: We have assessed potential cost impacts from the current tariffs which have been announced and implemented for the full-year 2025 before any additional mitigation actions; however, given the uncertainty of what the tariff rates could be and the timing of any additional mitigation actions, it is not possible to derive an accurate estimate of the net full-year 2025 impact of tariffs.\nTEXT: In 2025, we continue to expect restructuring costs of approximately $150 million to $200 million and expect capital expenditures of about $2.5 billion. We anticipate the annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, to be 23.0 percent in 2025.\nTEXT: Second-Quarter 2025 Company Trends and Expectations\nTEXT: In the second quarter of 2025, we expect sales and revenues to be similar to the second quarter of 2024. Sales growth in Energy & Transportation is expected to be offset by lower sales in Construction Industries and Resource Industries, primarily driven by unfavorable price realization. Machine sales volume is expected to be about flat.\nTEXT: In the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2024, we anticipate lower sales in Construction Industries primarily due to unfavorable price realization, partially offset by slightly higher sales volume. In Resource Industries, we expect lower sales primarily due to unfavorable price realization and slightly lower sales volume. In Energy & Transportation, we anticipate higher sales in the second quarter of 2025 as compared to the second quarter of 2024, primarily driven by strength in Power Generation and Oil and Gas. The strength in Oil and Gas is driven by turbines and turbine-related services. We expect favorable price realization for Energy & Transportation in the second quarter of 2025.\n"

These ME&T securities were $1.215 billion as of March 31, 2025 and are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position. We intend to maintain a strong cash and liquidity position.\nTEXT: Consolidated operating cash flow for the first three months of 2025 was $1.289 billion, down $763 million compared to the same period a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower profit before taxes adjusted for non-cash items.\nTEXT: Total debt as of March 31, 2025 was $38.588 billion, an increase of $179 million from year-end 2024.

Fitch maintains a \"high-A\" debt rating, while Moody’s and S&P maintain a “mid-A” debt rating. A downgrade of our credit ratings by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could make access to certain credit markets more difficult. In the event economic conditions deteriorate such that access to debt markets becomes unavailable, ME&T’s operations would rely on cash flow from operations, use of existing cash balances, borrowings from Cat Financial and access to our committed credit facilities. Our Financial Products’ operations would rely on cash flow from its existing portfolio, existing cash balances, access to our committed credit facilities and other credit line facilities of Cat Financial, and potential borrowings from Caterpillar.

We track a diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage, cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit rating agencies.\nTEXT: Operational excellence and commitments – Capital expenditures were $704 million during the first three months of 2025, compared to $502 million for the same period in 2024.

We define ME&T free cash flow as cash from ME&T operations less capital expenditures, excluding discretionary pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while maintaining our mid-A rating.\nTEXT: Each quarter, our Board of Directors reviews the company’s dividend for the applicable quarter. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the company and considers corporate cash flow, the company’s liquidity needs, the economic outlook, and the health and stability of global credit markets to determine whether to maintain or change the quarterly dividend. In April 2025, the Board of Directors approved maintaining our quarterly dividend representing $1.41 per share, and we continue to expect our strong financial position to support the dividend.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, and 2024, these items consist of (i) the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense and (ii) restructuring income related to the divestiture of a non-U.S. mining entity in 2024.
