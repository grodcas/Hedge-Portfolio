Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, inventory valuation, collectability of receivables, impairment of property and equipment and operating leases, valuation and impairment of investments, self-insurance liabilities, viewing patterns of capitalized video content, valuation of derivative instruments, and the determination of when to capitalize certain costs relating to new products or service offerings. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We review the useful lives of equipment on an ongoing basis.\nTEXT: Effective January 1, 2025 we changed our estimate of the useful lives of a subset of our servers and networking equipment from six years to five years. The shorter useful lives are due to the increased pace of technology development, particularly in the area of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were approximately $200 billion as of September 30, 2025. The weighted-average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.8 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term.\nTITLE: Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nTEXT: In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending existing income tax disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for income taxes paid and the effective tax rate reconciliation. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted and can be applied on either a prospective or retroactive basis. We expect to adopt the ASU on a retroactive basis.\nTEXT: In November 2024, the FASB issued an ASU amending existing income statement disclosure guidance, primarily requiring more detailed disclosure for expenses. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.

Cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

In making these estimates, we utilized valuation methods based on information available, including the rights and obligations of the convertible notes, other outstanding classes of securities, observable transactions such as new securities offerings, estimates of expected time to and type of liquidity events and anticipated securities offerings, and discounts for lack of marketability. Some of these notes converted to nonvoting preferred stock in Q1 2025. As a result of conversions, a significant portion of the unrealized gain associated with the notes as of December 31, 2024 was reclassified and a gain of approximately $3.3 billion was recorded in “Other income (expense), net” in our consolidated statement of operations. The investment in nonvoting preferred stock was initially recorded at its estimated fair value at the time of the conversion and will be accounted for as a component of our equity investments in private companies not accounted for under the equity-method, with future adjustments for observable changes in prices or impairments representing Level 3 fair value measurements recognized in “Other income\nTEXT: (expense), net” on our consolidated statements of operations.

These non-income tax controversies typically include (i) the taxability of products and services, including cross-border intercompany transactions, (ii) collection and withholding on transactions with third parties, including as a result of evolving requirements imposed on marketplaces with respect to third-party sellers, and (iii) the adequacy of compliance with reporting obligations, including evolving documentation requirements. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and the judicial and regulatory processes in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome of any such controversies may be materially different from our expectations.\n"

The first of these complaints was Frame-Wilson v. Amazon.com, Inc., which was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington (“W.D. Wash.”). These complaints seek billions of dollars of alleged damages, treble damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief, structural relief, civil penalties, attorneys’ fees, and costs. Some of the private plaintiff cases include allegations of distinct purported classes, including consumers who purchased a product through Amazon’s stores and consumers who purchased a product offered by Amazon through another e-commerce retailer. Some of the cases include allegations that Amazon has a monopoly in markets for online superstores, marketplace services, or intermediation services and that we unlawfully engage in anticompetitive practices relating to our pricing policies, selection of the Featured Offers, use of seller data, advertising practices, the structure of Prime, and promotion of our own products on our website. In the U.S., most of Amazon’s motions to dismiss were granted in part, but in each case, at least some of the claims survived. In Canada, class certification was denied in a case before the Federal Court of Canada, finding that plaintiffs had not stated a viable claim, and plaintiffs’ appeal of that ruling is pending. Two Canadian class actions before other courts are pre-certification. In the United Kingdom, two class actions have been certified and a third is pre-certification. In the U.S., one class action has been certified, and three others are pre-certification. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nTEXT: In December 2021, the Italian Competition Authority (the “ICA”) issued a decision against Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Europe Core S.à r.l., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Italia Services S.r.l., and Amazon Italia Logistica S.r.l. claiming that certain of our marketplace and logistics practices in Italy infringe EU competition rules. The decision imposes remedial actions and a fine of €1.13 billion, which we have paid and will seek to recover pending conclusion of all appeals. In September 2025, the Italian Administrative Tribunal (the “TAR”) affirmed the ICA’s decision but reduced the fine to €752 million. We believe the TAR’s ruling affirming the ICA’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.\nTEXT: In addition, we are regularly subject to claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including potential regulatory proceedings, involving patent and other intellectual property matters, taxes, labor and employment, competition and antitrust, privacy and data protection, consumer protection, commercial disputes, goods and services offered by us and by third parties, and other matters.\nTEXT: The outcomes of our legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular period. We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal proceedings and other contingencies that could affect the amount of liability, including amounts in excess of any previous accruals and reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our accruals and disclosures as appropriate. For the matters we disclose that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses, such an estimate is not possible or is immaterial, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Until the final resolution of such matters, if any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, we may experience losses in excess of the amounts recorded, which could have a material effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTEXT: See also “Note 7 — Income Taxes.”\nTITLE: Maturities (1)Stated Interest RatesEffective Interest RatesDecember 31, 2024September 30, 2025\nTITLE: Maturities (1)\nTITLE: Stated Interest Rates\nTITLE: Effective Interest Rates\nTITLE: December 31, 2024\n"

The Term Loan was classified as short-term debt and included within “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets.

There were no borrowings outstanding under the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. In October 2025, we replaced the 2024 Short-Term Credit Agreement with a new $5.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders on substantially the same terms, which matures in October 2026 and may be extended for one additional period of 364 days subject to approval by the lenders.\nTEXT: We also utilize other short-term credit facilities for working capital purposes. There were $151 million and $220 million of borrowings outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025, which were included in “Accrued expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we had $10.6 billion of unused letters of credit as of September 30, 2025.\nTITLE: Stock Repurchase Activity\nTEXT: In March 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock, with no fixed expiration.

Critical accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business, Accounting Policies, and Supplemental Disclosures” of our 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 1 — Accounting Policies and Supplemental Disclosures,” of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\nTEXT: Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2025, we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $435 million.\nTEXT: In addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\nTEXT: We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our actual and forecasted earnings are subject to\nTEXT: change due to economic, political, and other conditions and significant judgment is required in determining our ability to use our deferred tax assets.\nTEXT: Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes to our forecasts of income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of countries have enacted or are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\nTEXT: We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\n"

Amounts held in foreign currencies were $25.5 billion and $20.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2025. Our foreign currency balances include British Pounds, Canadian Dollars, Euros, Indian Rupees, and Japanese Yen.\nTEXT: Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $26.0 billion and $35.5 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $70.2 billion and $85.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year period, was due to an increase in net income, excluding non-cash expenses, and changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including variability in demand, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, customer and vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We expect to use cash on hand to satisfy the settlement of the FTC lawsuit.\nTEXT: Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, proceeds from asset sales, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(16.9) billion and $(26.1) billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(56.9) billion and $(95.3) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, with the variability caused primarily by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities and cash capital expenditures. Cash capital expenditures were $21.3 billion and $34.2 billion during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $51.6 billion and $89.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS business growth) and in additional capacity to support our fulfillment network, both of which we expect to increase in 2025 and 2026. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $622 million and $786 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $4.5 billion and $2.4 billion for the nine months ended\nTEXT: September 30, 2024 and 2025, which primarily reflect investments in convertible notes from Anthropic, including $1.3 billion we invested in Q2 2025. Furthermore, we will invest an additional $1.4 billion in another convertible note in Q4 2025.\nTEXT: Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(2.8) billion and $(44) million for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $(8.5) billion and $(2.6) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash inflows from financing activities resulted from proceeds from short-term debt, and other and long-term debt of $1.7 billion and $3.2 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $2.6 billion and $7.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Cash outflows from financing activities resulted from payments of short-term debt, and other, long-term debt, finance leases, and financing obligations of $4.5 billion and $3.3 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $11.1 billion and $10.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Property and equipment acquired under finance leases was $186 million and $977 million during Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $409 million and $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.\nTEXT: We had no borrowings outstanding under the two unsecured revolving credit facilities or the commercial paper programs as of September 30, 2025. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information.\nTEXT: Certain foreign subsidiary earnings and losses are subject to current U.S. taxation and the subsequent repatriation of those earnings is not subject to tax in the U.S. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.\nTEXT: Our U.S. taxable income is reduced by accelerated depreciation deductions and the resulting U.S. tax liability is reduced by tax credits, primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. The 2025 Tax Act makes changes to the U.S. corporate income tax, including reinstating the option to claim 100% accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property, with retroactive application beginning January 20, 2025 and immediate expensing of domestic research and development costs, with retroactive application beginning January 1, 2025. The 2025 Tax Act will significantly decrease our cash taxes in 2025. Cash paid for U.S. (federal and state) and foreign income taxes (net of refunds) totaled $2.0 billion and $1.1 billion for Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $8.2 billion and $6.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025.\n"

See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 4 — Commitments and Contingencies” and “Financial Statements — Note 5 — Debt” for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, we have purchase obligations and open purchase orders, including for inventory and capital expenditures, that support normal operations and are primarily due in the next twelve months. These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\nTEXT: We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain finance and operating lease arrangements, enter into financing obligations, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\nTEXT: The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, economic conditions and actions by policymaking bodies are contributing to changing interest rates and significant capital market volatility, which, along with any increases in our borrowing levels, could increase our future borrowing costs.\nTITLE: Results of Operations\nTEXT: We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, “Financial Statements — Note 8 — Segment Information.”\nTEXT: Macroeconomic factors, including changes in inflation and interest rates, global economic and geopolitical developments, including unpredictable shifts in global tariff and trade policies, and the development and adoption of technologies and services, including artificial intelligence, have direct and indirect impacts on our results of operations that are difficult to predict, isolate, and quantify. These could affect customer demand for our products and services, our ability to forecast growth needs, expenses, and benefits from new technologies. We expect some or all of them to continue to impact our operations into Q4 2025.\nTEXT: Net sales include product and service sales.

Changes in foreign exchange rates increased cost of sales by $929 million for Q3 2025, and by $917 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Shipping costs were $23.5 billion and $25.3 billion in Q3 2024 and Q3 2025, and $67.3 billion and $71.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2025. Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our customers. We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing rate, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes,\nTEXT: optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers.\nTEXT: Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\nTEXT: Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, physical stores, and customer service centers and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in “Fulfillment,” AWS costs are primarily classified as “Technology and infrastructure.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, the extent to which third-party sellers utilize Fulfillment by Amazon services, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, sales by our sellers have higher payment processing and related transaction costs as a percentage of net sales compared to our retail sales because payment processing costs are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions.\nTEXT: The increase in fulfillment costs in Q3 2025 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased sales and investments in our fulfillment network, partially offset by operational efficiencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased fulfillment costs by $214 million for Q3 2025, and by $209 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTEXT: We seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\nTEXT: Technology and infrastructure costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation and amortization, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers, including expenditures related to initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices and the development of a satellite network for global broadband service and autonomous vehicles for ride-hailing services.\n"

Our technology and infrastructure investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and infrastructure to increase over time as we continue to add employees and infrastructure. These costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and infrastructure costs in Q3 2025 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025, compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to an increase in spending on infrastructure, including depreciation and amortization, and severance costs. Changes in foreign exchange rates increased technology and infrastructure costs by $128 million for Q3 2025, but did not significantly impact technology and infrastructure costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2025. We currently expense the majority of the costs associated with the development of our satellite network for global broadband service (including production, launch, and payroll costs, and launch services deposits upon launch). We will capitalize certain of these costs once the service achieves commercial viability, including sales to customers.

The net loss of $(2.7) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily from the marketable securities loss from our equity investment in Rivian. The net gain of $10.2 billion in Q3 2025 and $14.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2025 is primarily from an upward adjustment for observable changes in price relating to our nonvoting preferred stock in Anthropic, and the reclassification adjustments for the gains on available-for-sale debt securities from the portions of our convertible notes investments in Anthropic that were converted to nonvoting preferred stock during Q3 2025 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2025.\nTEXT: Our income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $6.9 billion, which included $2.4 billion of net discrete tax benefits primarily attributable to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

These forward-looking statements reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of October 30, 2025, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions, tariff and trade policies, and customer demand and spending (including the impact of recessionary fears), inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services, and new and emerging technologies, as well as those outlined in Item 1A of Part II, “Risk Factors.”\nTEXT: •Net sales are expected to be between $206.0 billion and $213.0 billion, or to grow between 10% and 13% compared with fourth quarter 2024. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately 190 basis points from foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: •Operating income is expected to be between $21.0 billion and $26.0 billion, compared with $21.2 billion in fourth quarter 2024.\nTEXT: •This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nTITLE: Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds\n"

Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk is set forth below and in Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nTEXT: Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our long-term debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term marketable debt securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Marketable debt securities with fixed interest rates may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates.\nTEXT: During Q3 2025, net sales from our International segment accounted for 23% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared to rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales in Q3 2025 increased by $1.5 billion in comparison with Q3 2024.\nTEXT: We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of September 30, 2025, of $20.4 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in declines of $1.0 billion, $2.0 billion, and $4.1 billion.\nTEXT: We also have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of September 30, 2025, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange rates would result in losses of $350 million, $700 million, and $1.4 billion, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.”\nTEXT: See Item 2 of Part I, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2025, our recorded value in equity, equity warrant, and convertible debt investments in public and private companies was $46.9 billion. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies, which include our equity investment in Rivian, represent $4.8 billion of our investments as of September 30, 2025, and are recorded at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We record our equity warrant investments in private companies at fair value and adjust our equity investments in private companies, which primarily include our equity investment in Anthropic, for observable price changes or impairments. We record our available-for-sale convertible debt investments in private companies at fair value, which primarily relate to Anthropic. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data. The current global economic conditions provide additional uncertainty. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\n"
