The discontinuance of our DVD business had an immaterial impact on our operations and financial results.\nTEXT: (2) We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing the underlying trends in average monthly revenue per paying membership (“ARM”) absent foreign currency fluctuations. However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nTEXT: In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on ARM, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues. Constant currency percentage change in ARM is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency ARM and the prior comparative period ARM. The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our revenues would have been approximately $476 million and $1,177 million higher, respectively, excluding the impact of hedging and had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar.\nTEXT: Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased seven percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues and lower general and administrative expenses.\nTITLE: Streaming Revenues\nTEXT: We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan. As of September 30, 2024, pricing on our paid plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $33 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $8 per month. We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.\nTEXT: We also earn revenue from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.\nTEXT: Three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023\nTEXT: Three Months EndedChange September 30,2024September 30,2023Q3'24 vs. Q3'23 (in thousands, except percentages)Streaming revenues$9,824,703 $8,519,306 $1,305,397 15 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months Ended Change; September 30,2024 September 30,2023 Q3'24 vs. Q3'23; Streaming revenues $ 9,824,703 $ 8,519,306 $ 1,305,397 15 %.\nTITLE: Three Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Three Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: September 30,2024September 30,2023Q3'24 vs. Q3'23\nTITLE: September 30,2024\nTITLE: September 30,2023\nTITLE: Q3'24 vs. Q3'23\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023\nTEXT: Nine Months EndedChange September 30,2024September 30,2023YTD'24 vs. YTD'23 (in thousands, except percentages)Streaming revenues$28,754,453 $24,807,633 $3,946,820 16 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Nine Months Ended Change; September 30,2024 September 30,2023 YTD'24 vs. YTD'23; Streaming revenues $ 28,754,453 $ 24,807,633 $ 3,946,820 16 %.\nTITLE: Nine Months EndedChange\nTITLE: Nine Months Ended\nTITLE: Change\nTITLE: September 30,2024September 30,2023YTD'24 vs. YTD'23\nTITLE: September 30,2024\nTITLE: September 30,2023\nTITLE: YTD'24 vs. YTD'23\nTITLE: (in thousands, except percentages)\nTEXT: Streaming revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 15% and 16% as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, primarily due to the growth in average paying memberships and price increases, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: The following tables summarize streaming revenue and other streaming membership information by region for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Hedging gains of $48 million and $70 million are included in “Streaming revenues” for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

The amount of principal and interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is $2,579 million. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts had been borrowed under the $3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement. See Note 6 Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nTEXT: We anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital. Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nTEXT: In March 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in September 2023, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $10 billion, also with no expiration date.\nTEXT: Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 8,696,108 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $5.3 billion. As of September 30, 2024, $3.1 billion remains available for repurchases.\nTEXT: Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery and personnel-related costs, as well as strategic acquisitions and investments. Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period. Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content. For example, production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized. We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity.

Our exposure to market risk has not changed significantly since December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, we had $16.1 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fifteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054. Refer to Note 6 Debt to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.\nTEXT: We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies. Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 56% of revenue and 30% of operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, British pound, Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the Mexican peso.\nTEXT: Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have been approximately $1,177 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the devaluation of the Argentine peso relative to the U.S. dollar. See Part II, Item 7, \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 10% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1.9 billion and $958 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 10% as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $133 million and $71 million lower, respectively. This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures. We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.\n"

The decrease in the hypothetical adverse change in income before taxes from $516 million as of December 31, 2023 to $22 million as of September 30, 2024 is primarily driven by our use of non-derivative and derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to the remeasurement of foreign-currency denominated balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.\n"
