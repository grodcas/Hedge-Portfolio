As part of this transformation, we implemented the 2025 Restructuring Plan to lower expenses, streamline our organizational structure and reduce management layers across functions while reallocating resources toward our core client and server businesses by reducing investment in lower-priority programs and initiatives. We expect these headcount reduction initiatives will reduce our core Intel workforce by approximately 15% by the end of fiscal 2025, as compared to our Q2 2025 ending employee headcount. In YTD 2025, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.2 billion, consisting primarily of charges from our initiating and deploying the 2025 Restructuring Plan and including some remaining charges as we substantially completed the 2024 Restructuring Plan. Charges in YTD 2025 were primarily composed of cash-based employee severance and related employee exit charges of $1.8 billion and non-cash asset impairment charges of $416 million resulting from the exit of certain non-core lines of business and the consolidation and exit of certain real estate properties.\nTEXT: Our YTD 2025 results of operations were also affected by accelerated depreciation and impairment charges recognized for certain manufacturing assets that were determined to have no remaining operational use. This determination was based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services. These non-cash charges of $797 million, net of certain items, were recorded to cost of sales in Q2 2025, impacting the results for our Intel Foundry segment.\nTEXT: The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year comparisons in this discussion and analysis are, in many instances, materially impacted by the restructuring actions and other charges that occurred in Q3 2024. In Q3 2024, we announced, initiated and deployed our 2024 Restructuring Plan, and we recognized $2.8 billion of restructuring charges in Q3 2024, comprised primarily of cash-based employee severance and related employee exit charges of $2.2 billion, non-cash charges directly resulting from our decision to exit manufacturing capabilities for internal-use test hardware, resulting in the impairment of certain construction in progress assets of $442 million, and non-cash charges associated with real estate consolidation and exits that resulted in the impairment of certain operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements of $86 million.\nTEXT: In Q3 2024, our consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\nTEXT: ▪$3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node and also impacted the results of our Intel Foundry segment;\nTEXT: ▪$2.9 billion of non-cash charges, all of which were recorded as other charges in the restructuring and other line as presented in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations, which were associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets; and\nTEXT: ▪$9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets.\n"

The design, development, and manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing process technologies, or nodes, is risky and capital-intensive, and it takes years for capital investments to yield a return. Under our more disciplined approach, we intend to invest capital in future node development and additional or upgraded manufacturing facilities only where we have a clear line of sight to an acceptable return on that capital. We expect to release the first SKU of our first products manufactured on our new leading-edge node, Intel 18A, by the end of 2025, and continue to develop its derivative node, Intel 18A-P, designed for future Intel products and external customers. We are focused on the continued development of Intel 14A, the next generation node beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P, and on securing a significant external customer for such node. However, if we are unable to secure a significant external customer and meet important customer milestones for Intel 14A, we face the prospect that it will not be economical to develop and manufacture Intel 14A and successor leading-edge nodes on a go-forward basis. In such event, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of Intel 14A and successor nodes and various of our manufacturing expansion projects. While we continue to evaluate Intel 14A for use in future Intel products and our plan includes an initial product designed to utilize Intel 14A, at present we are maintaining the option to design future Intel products requiring nodes with performance beyond Intel 18A and Intel 18A-P to be produced internally or by an external foundry. If we were to discontinue development of Intel 14A and successor nodes, we expect that a majority of our products would continue to be manufactured in our own facilities utilizing our nodes up to Intel 18A-P through at least 2030. By focusing on our customers and delivering the best semiconductor products to the market, manufactured on the most appropriate internal or external node from a performance and cost perspective, and only deploying capital on new nodes and manufacturing facilities where we believe they will yield an attractive return, we believe we can improve the competitiveness of our products business, and the overall financial results for the company.\nTITLE: Table of Contents\nTEXT: Risks to Operations from Hostilities in Israel\nTEXT: During YTD 2025, hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region escalated significantly, including direct military actions between Israel and Iran and military strikes by the United States against Iran. While a truce was recently reached among parties to the conflict in Israel, there can be no assurance that any existing or future ceasefire agreements will be respected or remain in force, and additional hostilities and escalations remain possible at any time. We continue to monitor the impact this geopolitical conflict could have on our operations in Israel, including potential disruption of our wafer fabrication facility and our product development centers. To date, we have not had a material interruption in either our manufacturing operations or our product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions resulting from war or political violence, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and equipment assets in Israel are self-insured for losses resulting from war or political violence which could be impacted by the conflict.\nTEXT: In Q1 2025, we made an organizational change to integrate NEX into CCG and DCAI and modified our segment reporting to align to this and certain other business reorganizations. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODM internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance. There were no changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods. Our discussion regarding our segments' results of operations presented below excludes restructuring and other charges for all periods presented, as our CODM receives, views and uses information for decision making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items. \"Note 2: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q provides additional information about our operating segments, including the nature of segment revenues and expenses, and reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total consolidated net revenues and our segment operating income (loss) presented below to our total consolidated operating income (loss) for each of the periods presented.\n"

Intersegment revenue was $13.2 billion, up $364 million from YTD 2024, primarily due to higher back-end services revenue, and higher wafer volume from our Intel 3 and Intel 4 process nodes, partially offset by lower intersegment sample revenue. External revenue was $85 million, down $22 million from YTD 2024.\nTEXT: Operating loss was $2.3 billion in Q3 2025, compared to an operating loss of $5.8 billion in Q3 2024, primarily driven by the absence of $3.1 billion of non-cash asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges recognized in Q3 2024, which were related to manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node. Additionally, Q3 2025 benefited from $421 million of lower operating expenses in Q3 2025, primarily due to lower payroll-related expenditures as a result of headcount reductions taken under the 2025 and 2024 Restructuring Plans and the effects of various cost-reduction measures.\nTEXT: Operating loss was $7.8 billion in YTD 2025, compared to an operating loss of $11.0 billion in YTD 2024. The YTD 2025 change was primarily driven by the reduced impacts of $797 million in charges recognized in Q2 2025 related to certain manufacturing assets that were determined to have no remaining operational use based on an evaluation of our current process technology node capacities and projected market demand for our products and services in comparison to $3.1 billion of non-cash asset impairment and accelerated depreciation charges recognized in Q3 2024, as described above. Additionally, YTD 2025 benefited from $743 million of lower operating expenses, primarily due to lower payroll-related expenditures, resulting from headcount reductions taken under the 2025 and 2024 Restructuring Plans, and the effects of various other cost-reduction measures, and higher intersegment revenue.\nTEXT: Our \"all other\" category includes the results of operations from other non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, including our Mobileye business, our IMS business, start-up businesses that support our initiatives, and historical results of operations from divested businesses, including Altera.

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections, we have provided additional risk factors below.\nTEXT: There is limited precedent for the accounting treatment for our transactions with the U.S. government and we have been unable to conclude our consultation with the staff of the SEC; if the staff of the SEC were to have a different view of the appropriate accounting treatment, we may materially revise our third quarter financial results, including the recognition of additional costs or losses, and our results for future periods may also be materially and adversely impacted.\nTEXT: Our transactions with the U.S. government during the third quarter of 2025, including the equity issuances and the amendment to our commercial CHIPs Act agreement, are complex. Refer to \"Note 4: Earnings (Loss) Per Share and Stockholders' Equity\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional information. There is limited precedent for the accounting treatment of such transactions. While we believe we have selected the appropriate accounting approach for these transactions in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q, there are other potential approaches that, if applied, would result in materially different financial results for our third quarter of 2025 and could also materially and adversely impact our results for future periods. Given the complexity associated with these transactions, we recently initiated a consultation with the staff of the SEC to seek confirmation that they do not disagree with our accounting treatment. Due to the current U.S. government shutdown, we have been unable to conclude our consultation with the staff of the SEC. If the staff of the SEC were to have a different view of the appropriate accounting treatment of these transactions, we may materially revise our third quarter 2025 financial results, including the recognition of additional costs or losses, and our results for future periods may also be materially and adversely impacted.\nTEXT: The U.S. government’s acquisition and ownership of significant equity interests in the company may subject us and our stockholders to a number of risks and uncertainties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or adversely impact the interests of our other stockholders.\nTEXT: ■The accelerated CHIPs Act funds we received from the U.S. government connected to the issuance of our equity securities to the U.S. government may be subject to risks from changes in laws, regulations, or their interpretations, as well as shifts in federal administration and congressional priorities. The legislative, judicial or executive branches of the U.S. government could determine in the future that all or a portion of the transactions pursuant to which the U.S. government acquired our equity securities were unauthorized, void or voidable. In addition, the terms of our agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce for the acquisition of our securities and the amendment of our commercial CHIPs Act agreement are subject to unilateral amendment by the U.S. Department of Commerce to comply with future changes in federal law. Further, while the U.S. Department of Commerce is contractually bound under our agreements with them, no other agency or branch of the U.S. government has made commitments to support, refrain from challenging or otherwise impeding the transaction. Legal challenges, administrative rulings, litigation by other parts of the U.S. government or third parties, or geopolitical developments could materially impair funding, alter obligations under the commercial CHIPs Act agreement or our Secure Enclave agreement, or otherwise adversely affect the transactions and the benefits that we expect to receive under such agreements. In addition, enforcement against a government counterparty is inherently uncertain given the defenses available to the U.S. government.\nTEXT: ■The transactions eliminate our contractual rights to receive future funds under the commercial CHIPs Act agreement in the form of a grant and may limit our ability to secure grants from government entities in the future. By eliminating future grant funding under the commercial CHIPs Act agreement, the transactions make it such that our business will no longer benefit from the reduced future operating costs made possible by such grant funding. In addition, our business is highly capital intensive and we have a number of other current grant arrangements with government entities, and may seek to pursue such arrangements in the future. It is uncertain whether the transactions may cause other government entities to seek to convert their existing grant arrangements with us into equity or be unwilling to support us with future grants, either of which could limit our access to capital, increase our cost of capital, or increase our future operating costs.\n"

As a result of the transactions, the U.S. government is one of our largest stockholders (5.8% as of September 27, 2025) and may acquire additional shares of our common stock as shares are released from escrow to the U.S. government as we perform under and receive disbursements for Secure Enclave (up to an additional 3.2%) or if the conditions to the warrants are triggered (we no\nTEXT: longer control 51% of our foundry business within the next five years) and the warrants are exercised (up to an additional 4.8%). The U.S. government’s interests may not be the same as those of other stockholders. The U.S. government has agreed to vote its shares of common stock as recommended by our board of directors, subject to applicable law and exceptions to protect the U.S. government’s interests. This reduces the voting influence of other stockholders with respect to the selection of our directors and proposals voted on by stockholders. The existence of the significant U.S. government equity interest in us, the voting of the U.S. government's shares either as directed by our board of directors or the U.S. government, and the U.S. government’s substantial additional powers with respect to the laws and regulations impacting our business, may substantially limit our ability to pursue potential future strategic transactions that may be beneficial to stockholders, including by potentially limiting the willingness of other third parties to engage in such potential strategic transactions with us.\nTEXT: ■Our non-U.S. business may be adversely impacted by the U.S. government being a significant stockholder. Sales outside the U.S. accounted for 76% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024. Having the U.S. government as a significant stockholder could subject us to additional regulations, obligations or restrictions, such as foreign subsidy laws or otherwise, in other countries.\nTEXT: ■We may experience other adverse consequences resulting from the announcement or completion of the transactions. There is limited precedent for a U.S. company such as us having the U.S. government take a position as a significant stockholder. As such, it is difficult to foresee all the potential consequences. Among other things, there could be adverse reactions, immediately or over time, from investors, employees, customers, suppliers, other business or commercial partners, foreign governments or competitors. There may also be litigation related to the transaction or otherwise and increased public or political scrutiny with respect to us.\nTEXT: Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, operations, financial position, cash flows, access to financing, cost structure, competitiveness, reputation, profitability, and prospects and could exacerbate other risks discussed in our 2024 Form 10-K, Q1 2025 Form 10-Q and Q2 2025 Form 10-Q.\nTEXT: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nTEXT: We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. We performed an evaluation of these risks to our financial positions as of December 28, 2024, and updated that analysis as of September 27, 2025, to determine whether material changes in market risks pertaining to currency and interest rates or equity and commodity prices have occurred as a result of the changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls. No material revisions were noted since disclosing \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A, in our 2024 Form 10-K. Risks related to changes in international trade policies, including tariffs and export controls, particularly those involving the United States and China are described under \"Risk Factors\" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information in our 2024 Form 10-K and in our Q1 2025 Form 10-Q.\nTEXT: Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nTEXT: Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nTEXT: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n"

No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending September 27, 2025. As of September 27, 2025, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.\nTEXT: We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.\nTEXT: Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nTEXT: Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended September 27, 2025, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.\nTEXT: Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\nTEXT: Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific U.S. economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.\nTEXT: On April 15, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.\n"
