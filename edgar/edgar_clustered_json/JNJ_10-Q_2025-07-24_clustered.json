Fair value is a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nTEXT: The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nTEXT: The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nTEXT: Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nTEXT: Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nTITLE: 14\nTEXT: The Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of June 29, 2025 and December 29, 2024 were as follows:\nTEXT: June 29, 2025December 29, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)Derivatives designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts $—1,006—1,006660Interest rate contracts(2)—431—4311,484Total —1,437—1,4372,144Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —774—774794Interest rate contracts(2) —6,234—6,2343,753Total —7,008—7,0084,547Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Assets: Forward foreign exchange contracts —57—5750Liabilities: Forward foreign exchange contracts —72—7217Other Investments:Equity investments(3)453——453451Debt securities(4)—2,094—2,0947,216Other Liabilities:Contingent consideration(5)$——1,1571,1571,217\nTABLE: TABLE: June 29, 2025 December 29, 2024; (Dollars in Millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Total(1); Forward foreign exchange contracts $— 1,006 — 1,006 660; Interest rate contracts(2) — 431 — 431 1,484; Total — 1,437 — 1,437 2,144; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 774 — 774 794; Interest rate contracts(2) — 6,234 — 6,234 3,753; Total — 7,008 — 7,008 4,547; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 57 — 57 50; Forward foreign exchange contracts — 72 — 72 17; Equity investments(3) 453 — — 453 451; Debt securities(4) — 2,094 — 2,094 7,216; Contingent consideration(5) $— — 1,157 1,157 1,217.\nTITLE: June 29, 2025December 29, 2024\nTITLE: June 29, 2025\nTITLE: December 29, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalTotal(1)\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTITLE: Level 1\nTITLE: Level 2\nTITLE: Level 3\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Total(1)\nTITLE: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Total —1,437—1,4372,144\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Total —7,008—7,0084,547\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nTITLE: Assets:\nTITLE: Liabilities:\nTITLE: Other Investments:\nTITLE: Other Liabilities:\nTEXT: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationJune 29, 2025December 29, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Total Gross Assets$1,4942,194Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(1,471)(2,172)Total Net Asset2322Total Gross Liabilities7,0804,564Credit Support Agreement (CSA)(6,666)(4,412)Total Net Liabilities$414152\nTABLE: TABLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation June 29, 2025 December 29, 2024; Total Gross Assets $1,494 2,194; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (1,471) (2,172); Total Net Asset 23 22; Total Gross Liabilities 7,080 4,564; Credit Support Agreement (CSA) (6,666) (4,412); Total Net Liabilities $414 152.\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative ReconciliationJune 29, 2025December 29, 2024\nTITLE: Gross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\nTITLE: June 29, 2025\nTITLE: December 29, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTEXT: Summarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration for the fiscal second quarters ended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024 is as follows:\nTEXT: June 29, 2025June 30, 2024(Dollars in Millions)Beginning Balance$1,2171,092Changes in estimated fair value(6) (60)44Additions—112Payments——Ending Balance$1,1571,248\nTABLE: TABLE: June 29, 2025 June 30, 2024; Beginning Balance $1,217 1,092; Changes in estimated fair value(6) (60) 44; Additions — 112; Payments — —; Ending Balance $1,157 1,248.\nTITLE: June 29, 2025June 30, 2024\nTITLE: June 29, 2025\nTITLE: June 30, 2024\nTITLE: (Dollars in Millions)\nTEXT: Changes in estimated fair value(6)\nTEXT: (1)2024 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $451 million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $1,217 million, classified as Level 3.\nTEXT: (2)Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\nTEXT: (3)Classified as non-current other assets.\nTITLE: Form 10-Q15\n"

In June 2020, the Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $4.7 billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $2.1 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $2.5 billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nTEXT: In an effort to expeditiously resolve the litigation for the overwhelming majority of claimants, beginning in October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring, through which Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nTEXT: Following the 2021 Corporate Restructuring, Debtor and the Company attempted to achieve a full and comprehensive resolution of the Talc-Related Liabilities. Debtor filed voluntary petitions for Bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in October 2021 and again in April 2023; both petitions were dismissed.\nTEXT: In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision; (ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative claims against experts for false and defamatory narratives\nTITLE: Form 10-Q31\n"

In December 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (LLT).\nTEXT: In May 2024, the Company commenced a three-month solicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the Proposed Plan) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $6.475 billion payable over 25 years (nominal value of approximately $8.0 billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constituted 99.75% of then-pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products.\nTEXT: In August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (Red River); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (Pecos River); and (3) New Holdco (Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated to Pecos River.\nTEXT: While the Company had resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date as of August 2024, cases continue to be filed. Trials have commenced in various state courts.\nTEXT: In September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red River filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the Company's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Shortly thereafter, as a consequence of this filing, the Company withdrew its appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision.\nTEXT: To account for the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $5.0 billion during fiscal year 2024. As of the end of fiscal year 2024, the total present value of the reserve was approximately $11.6 billion (or nominal value of approximately $13.5 billion).\nTEXT: On March 31, 2025, the Texas Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the case (the Texas dismissal) and, as a result, the Company reversed substantially all, or approximately $7 billion, from amounts previously reserved for the bankruptcy resolution. As of the second quarter 2025, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $4.0 billion, comprising previously executed settlement agreements, litigation defense and other costs. Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability.\nTEXT: After the Texas dismissal, the Company announced it would not appeal the decision and returned to the tort system to litigate the talc claims and defend the safety of its products. Courts have begun to hold scheduling conferences and the Company is preparing to start bellwether trials in consolidated proceedings in the California JCCP in November 2025 and in the New Jersey MCL in January 2026.\nTEXT: In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy) seeking indemnification from the Company and rights to joint insurance proceeds.\nTEXT: In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan) also asserting claims for indemnity against the Company arising out of personal injury claims.\nTEXT: In July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities), and the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in the Imerys debtors' and Cyprus debtors' respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve the parties ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. In October 2024, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Order).\nTEXT: Certain insurers have appealed the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the Delaware Bankruptcy Court denied in January 2025. The insurers then sought a stay of the order in the District Court for the District of Delaware, which also was denied. The insurers then appealed the denial of their request for a stay of the order to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing of the Settlement Order appeal in the Delaware District Court was completed in April 2025, and the appeal is pending a decision from the Court. The briefing in the Third Circuit appeal of the denial of the stay order is ongoing.\nTEXT: In January 2025, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their respective Chapter 11 plans had been accepted by each voting class of talc claimants. A joint confirmation hearing for the plans began in April 2025 but was continued, at the request of Imerys and Cyprus, after issues arose relating to treatment of foreign claims under their respective Chapter 11 plans.\n"

In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class certification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation.

(JPI), along with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500 lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids, including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTEXT: To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at trial or on appeal.\nTEXT: In July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up to $5.0 billion. Approximately 80% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal second quarter 2025. A few government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases.\nTEXT: The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as the cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are under 27 remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts, 290 remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 2 additional cases in other federal courts.\nTEXT: In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. The defendants, including the Company, filed appeals from the certification order in late February 2025. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.\nTEXT: Starting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had been dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\nTITLE: Product liability\nTEXT: The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes available.\nTEXT: The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product or product category as of June 29, 2025\nTITLE: Form 10-Q33\n"

(DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000 claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nTITLE: DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nTEXT: Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nTITLE: Ethicon Pelvic Mesh\nTEXT: Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa.

A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600 Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300 plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729 cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.\nTEXT: Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United States.\nTEXT: Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System.

These lawsuits, which allege that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada.

Although these subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nTITLE: Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nTEXT: The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA (or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products.

The increase in SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA sales was primarily driven by the Merck, Sharp & Dohme return of rights in Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. The increase in REMICADE (infliximab) sales was due to favorable patient mix, market growth, and the Merck, Sharp & Dohme return of rights in Europe, partially offset by biosimilar competition.\nTEXT: Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA. The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.

This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute.

The operational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by technology penetration and upgrades within the differentiated Wound Closure portfolio.\nTEXT: The Orthopaedics franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 1.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter. All platforms were impacted by revenue disruption from the previously announced Orthopaedics restructuring. The operational decline in Hips reflects the negative impact of China volume-based procurement and trade inventory dynamics partially offset by procedure growth. The operational decline in Knees was driven by competitive pressures and market headwinds, partially offset by strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solutions. The operational decline in Trauma was primarily driven by the lapping of the strong prior year comparator partially offset by recently launched products, procedure growth and commercial execution.

In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nTEXT: Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents are in place.\nTITLE: Item 3 — Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk\n"
