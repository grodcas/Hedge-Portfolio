The cash outflow was primarily driven by our commercial airplane business. Commercial airplane cash outflows reflect slowed production and deliveries as a result of ongoing safety and quality improvement actions the Company is taking following the Alaska Airlines accident on January 5, 2024, as well as supply chain constraints. Additionally, the ongoing work stoppage initiated on September 13, 2024, by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 (IAM 751) has paused production of certain commercial aircraft models (737, 767, 777 and 777X aircraft) as well as production of commercial derivative aircraft for our Defense, Space & Security business (KC-46A Tanker and P-8A Poseidon). The IAM 751 work stoppage is also significantly reducing aircraft deliveries and adversely impacting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTEXT: At September 30, 2024, cash and short-term investments totaled $10.5 billion. Our total debt balance was $57.7 billion at September 30, 2024, up from $52.3 billion at December 31, 2023. On May 1, 2024, we issued $10 billion of fixed-rate senior notes. At September 30, 2024, we had $10.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. On May 15, 2024, we entered into a $4.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in May 2029. Our $3.0 billion three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025 and $3.0 billion five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2028 each remain in effect. We anticipate these credit lines will primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general borrowing needs. On October 14, 2024, we entered into a $10.0 billion 364-day supplemental credit agreement (see Note 12 for additional information). We continue to be in full compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit facility agreements.\nTEXT: We continue to maintain investment grade credit ratings. Moody’s downgraded our short term and long term credit ratings to Baa3/P-3 in April 2024. Moody's and S&P placed our ratings on review for downgrade in September 2024 and October 2024, respectively. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and/or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets, including further credit rating downgrades. At September 30, 2024, trade payables included $2.7 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs compared with $2.9 billion at December 31, 2023. In future quarters, our suppliers' access to supply chain financing could be curtailed or more expensive if our credit ratings are further downgraded.\nTEXT: We are implementing actions to improve liquidity. We instituted temporary furloughs and hiring freezes across the Company for all levels and paused pay increases for executive and management promotions. We are reducing discretionary spending as well as reducing or deferring non-essential capital expenditures. We are also pausing the issuance of the majority of supplier purchase orders on the 737, 767, 777, and 777X programs due to IAM 751's ongoing work stoppage. In addition, on October 11, 2024, we announced that we plan to reduce the size of our total workforce by roughly 10 percent.\nTEXT: Our planned acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc. (Spirit) will be an all-stock transaction pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger entered into on June 30, 2024 (see Note 2 for additional information).\nTEXT: Notwithstanding the actions described above to improve liquidity, we expect negative operating cash flows in future quarters until IAM 751 employees return to work, production resumes and deliveries ramp up.\nTEXT: Based on our current best estimates of market demand, planned production rates, timing of cash receipts and expenditures, and our expected ability to successfully implement actions to improve liquidity, we believe it is probable that we will be able to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. We also believe we have the ability to access additional liquidity.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nTITLE: Goodwill\nTEXT: We performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of April 1, 2024, using a qualitative assessment. We determined the fair value of each of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values. Our Military Aircraft reporting unit within our Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment had goodwill of $1,295 and a negative carrying value at September 30, 2024.\n"

We expensed abnormal production costs of $442 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the 777X program resumed production, and as a result, there were no abnormal production costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the third quarter of 2024, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus the costs already included in 777X inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $2,608 was recorded as a reduction of deferred production costs. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include aircraft certification requirements and timing, change incorporation on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability (including the ongoing work stoppage) and supply chain disruption, customer delivery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity.

The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on invoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within 30 to 90 days but may extend up to 12 months.

See Note 1.\nTITLE: Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts\nTEXT: Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed.\nTEXT: We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. In addition, we are making certain capital expenditures in anticipation of future contract awards that have risk for impairment if we are not selected.\nTITLE: Fixed-Price Contracts\nTEXT: Long-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for the development of new products, services and related technologies. Estimating the cost and time for us and our suppliers to complete these contracts is inherently uncertain due to operational and technical complexities. This uncertainty requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions about future operational and technical performance, and the outcome of customer and/or supplier contractual negotiations. The risk that actual performance, technical or contractual outcomes could be different than those previously assumed creates financial risk that could trigger additional material earnings charges, termination provisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\nTITLE: VC-25B Presidential Aircraft\nTEXT: The Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the U.S. Air Force’s (USAF) VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $4 billion program to develop and modify two 747-8 commercial aircraft. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $482 driven by engineering changes to support the build and installation process; the resolution of supplier negotiations; and factory performance related to labor instability. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $250 primarily driven by higher than anticipated costs due to engineering design changes related to wiring and other structural requirements. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n"

Since 2016, the USAF has authorized 10 low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of 139 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $27 billion as of September 30, 2024. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of the 767 commercial airplane program with the majority of the manufacturing costs being incurred in the 767 factory and the remaining costs being incurred in the military finishing and delivery centers.\nTEXT: During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $309 primarily resulting from factory disruption and additional rework due to a supplier quality issue. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $128, primarily due to factory disruption associated with supply chain constraints. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $391, primarily reflecting higher than anticipated factory disruption, including supply chain constraints and parts shortages. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $661 to reflect higher than anticipated factory disruption, higher estimated supplier costs, the projected impacts of IAM 751 contract negotiations and the ongoing work stoppage, and increased cost allocations primarily resulting from lower commercial airplane production rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately $137 of capitalized precontract costs and $313 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to future production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: MQ-25\nTEXT: In the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that now includes development and delivery of seven aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890. In connection with winning the competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of\nTEXT: $291 in the third quarter of 2018. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $231 primarily driven by production and flight testing delays as well as higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft attributable to factory performance. During the first quarter of 2024, we were awarded a cost-type contract modification totaling $657 for two additional test aircraft plus other scope increases. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss by $217 primarily reflecting higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft. The initial EMD units are currently progressing through the factory and the increase reflects recent and projected factory performance as well as the higher than anticipated complexity of the production build. We expect the initial units to complete production in 2025 and begin flight testing. We will be initiating final assembly operations at our new facility at Mid-America St. Louis Airport in Mascoutah, Illinois, in early 2025. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nTITLE: T-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options\nTEXT: In 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $860 fixed-price contract and includes five aircraft and seven simulators. The production portion of the contract includes 11 production lots for aircraft and related services for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. Four EMD aircraft have been delivered as of September 30, 2024, and the flight testing is ongoing. We expect the first production and support contract option to be exercised in 2025 with the remaining lots expected to be exercised annually thereafter.\nTEXT: During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $275 primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the T-7A Red Hawk program by $94 primarily reflecting further increases in estimated production costs. During the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $278 primarily driven by higher than anticipated costs to meet certain technical and support requirements, and flight test program inefficiencies and delays. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $908 primarily to reflect higher estimated supplier costs related to future production lots. The higher estimated supplier costs are based on our updated assessment that previously assumed cost estimates are not projected to be realized in the current environment based on ongoing contracting activity and discussions with suppliers. The revised estimates include priced options or not-to-exceed pricing for contractually committed suppliers and escalated current prices for uncontracted work. We also provisioned for a supplier not fulfilling their contractual requirements for certain production lots. The charge also includes a provision related to certain equipment no longer assumed to be customer-furnished. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately $285 of capitalized precontract costs and $594 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to certain long-lead items for the first 4 production lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\n"

In the second quarter of 2022, we successfully completed the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test. During 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $288 primarily as a result of delaying the Crewed Flight Test (CFT) following notification by a parachute supplier of an issue identified through testing. The CFT launched on June 5, 2024, and docked with the ISS. The Starliner spacecraft had a minimum mission duration of 8 days. Its return to Earth was delayed to allow time to perform further testing of propulsion system anomalies and returned to Earth uncrewed in September 2024. As a result of the CFT delays, during the second quarter of 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $125. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we increased the reach-forward loss on the program by $250 primarily to reflect schedule delays and higher testing and certification costs.

Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.\nTEXT: If a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent repurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.\nTEXT: Credit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the original lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on behalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.\nTEXT: Other Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities.

The PRSUs granted under this program have a grant date fair value of $192.94 per unit. The award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial PRSU grant based on cumulative free cash flow achievement over the period January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026 as compared to the target set at the start of the performance period, as well as the achievement of certain safety goals. The PRSUs granted under this program will vest at the payout amount determined on the third anniversary of the grant date and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis). If an executive terminates employment because of retirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, may receive some or all of their stock units depending on certain age and service conditions.

(Spirit) on February 28, 2024. The FAA found multiple instances where the companies failed to comply with manufacturing quality control requirements and provided 90 days from March 1, 2024, to submit a corrective action plan. On May 30, 2024, we submitted our safety and quality plan to address the issues identified by the FAA.\nTEXT: Our planned production rates are dependent on our suppliers' ability to support our operations and our ability to meet heightened quality control requirements. Prior to the Alaska Airlines accident, we were operating at a production rate of 38 per month. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as part of our plan to address the issues identified, we slowed production rates and delayed planned production rate increases to reduce traveled work in our factory, as well as at our suppliers. During the first quarter of 2024, we began conducting fuselage inspections at Spirit to improve quality prior to shipment to Boeing. In the second quarter of 2024, production rates gradually increased as we implemented new processes as part of our safety and quality plan. In the third quarter of 2024, we continued to gradually increase production aligned with our safety and quality plan. However, production has been paused since September 13, 2024, as a result of the ongoing work stoppage initiated by IAM 751. Prior to the work stoppage, we were working toward a production rate of 38 per month by the end of 2024, which we now expect to be delayed by the work stoppage.\nTEXT: As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 60 737-8 aircraft in inventory that were produced prior to 2023, including approximately 45 aircraft for customers in China. Deliveries are being impacted by the work stoppage.\nTEXT: We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10 models. During the first quarter of 2024, the program completed the first phase of FAA certification flight testing for the 737-10. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 35 737-7 and 737-10 aircraft in inventory. We are planning to incorporate engineering solutions to the anti-icing systems on the 737-7 and 737-10 prior to certification, which has delayed certification and first deliveries.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 10 and Note 18 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 767 Program The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. We are currently at a production rate of approximately 3 aircraft per month. We are continuing to experience factory disruption, including supply chain delays and quality issues. We have slowed production in 2024 to reduce traveled work in our factory and enable supply chain recovery, resulting in higher near-term production costs.\nTEXT: We expect to end production of the 767 freighter program in 2027. As a result of this decision, the accounting quantity for the 767 program was decreased by 9 units during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Impacts of this decision, as well as the ongoing IAM 751 work stoppage and contract negotiations, and higher costs driven by ongoing factory disruption resulted in a $0.4 billion reach-forward loss on the 767 freighter program in the third quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: See further discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program in Note 10 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: 777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 20 units during the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. While production is currently paused, prior to the work stoppage, we were at a combined production rate of 4 per month for the 777/777X programs. Prior to the work stoppage, the programs experienced factory disruption including 777 supply chain delays and quality issues, and challenges associated with 777X production. In July 2024, we obtained approval from the FAA to begin the first phase of FAA certification flight testing. Flight testing was paused in August when a cracked engine thrust link was discovered in a flight test aircraft and remained paused as of September 30, 2024. The flight test aircraft were subsequently approved for flight; however, the resumption of flight activities will be impacted by the work stoppage.\n"

Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financing position, and/or cash flows.\nTEXT: The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories.

Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise.

Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs.

These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure.
