The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections:\nTEXT: •Economic Conditions and Uncertainties\nTEXT: •Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity\nTEXT: •Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nTEXT: Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, including organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 15\nTEXT: definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure.\nTEXT: Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\nTITLE: OVERVIEW\nTEXT: P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

Delivering and sustaining leadership levels of shareholder value creation requires balanced top- and bottom-line growth and strong cash generation.\nTEXT: Our strategy is to deliver and sustain value creation through five integrated choices: a portfolio of daily-use products where performance drives brand choice; superiority across product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value; productivity; constructive disruption of the entire value chain; and a highly efficient and effective organization structure.\nTEXT: The Company competes in daily-use product categories where performance plays a significant role in the consumer's choice of brands, and therefore, plays to P&G's strengths. Our focused portfolio of businesses consists of product categories where P&G has strong brands and consumer-meaningful product technologies with typically leadership market positions.\nTEXT: Within these categories, our strategic choices are focused on delighting and winning with consumers. Our consumers are at the center of everything we do. We win with consumers by delivering irresistible superiority across five key vectors - product performance, packaging, brand communication, retail execution and value. Winning with consumers around the world and against our best competitors requires superior innovation. Innovation has always been, and continues to be, P&G’s lifeblood. Superior products delivered with superior execution drive market growth, value creation for retailers and build share growth for P&G.\nTEXT: Ongoing productivity improvement is strategic and crucial to delivering our balanced top- and bottom-line growth, cash generation and value creation objectives. Productivity improvement enables investments to strengthen the superiority of our brands via product and packaging innovation, more efficient and effective supply chains, equity and awareness-building brand advertising and other programs and expansion of sales coverage and R&D programs. Productivity improvements also enable us to mitigate and manage through periods of challenging cost environments (including periods of increasing commodity, inflation and negative foreign exchange impacts). Our objective is to drive productivity improvements across all elements of the statement of earnings and balance sheet, including cost of goods sold, marketing and promotional spending, overhead costs and capital spending.\nTEXT: We act with agility and are constructively disrupting our highly competitive industry and the way we do business, including how we innovate, communicate and leverage new technologies, to create more value.\nTEXT: We are improving operational effectiveness and organizational culture through enhanced clarity of roles and responsibilities, accountability and incentive compensation programs.\nTEXT: Additionally, to further strengthen our integrated strategy, we have declared four focus areas. These are 1) leveraging environmental sustainability as an additional driver of superior performing products and packaging innovations, 2) increasing digital acumen to drive consumer and customer preference, reduce cost and enable rapid and efficient decision making, 3) developing next-level supply chain capabilities to enable flexibility, agility, resilience and a new level of productivity and 4) delivering a superior employee value equation for all employees inclusive of all genders, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, ages and abilities - for all roles - to ensure we continue to attract, retain and develop the best talent to better serve our diverse consumer base.\nTEXT: We believe this strategy is right for the long-term health of the Company and our objective of delivering total shareholder return in the top one-third of our peer group.\nTEXT: The Company expects the delivery of the following long-term growth algorithm will result in total shareholder returns in the top third of the competitive, fast-moving consumer goods peer group:\nTEXT: •Organic sales growth above market growth rates in the categories and geographies in which we compete;\nTEXT: •Core EPS growth of mid-to-high single digits; and\nTEXT: •Adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90% or greater.\nTEXT: While periods of significant macroeconomic pressures may cause short-term results to deviate from the long-term growth algorithm, we intend to maintain a disciplined approach to investing in our business.\nTEXT: 18 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTITLE: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS\n"

In connection with this announcement, the Company announced that it expected to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2024, the Company has substantially liquidated its operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, and recorded a non-cash charge of $216 million after tax for accumulated currency translation losses previously included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of its business in Argentina. The Company expects to record a non-cash charge of approximately $750 million for accumulated currency translation losses in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges were funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs were reported as non-core charges.

The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.

Our products are sold in numerous countries worldwide, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised approximately 20% of our net sales in fiscal 2024. As a result, we are exposed to global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions and government policies. We are exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments due to economic, political and social instabilities, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, currency controls, foreign exchange and interest rate changes. These risks can negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. For example, we are exposed to risks due to the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine. Our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales, net earnings and net assets as of June 30, 2024.\nTEXT: Foreign Exchange. We have significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, both due to translation and transaction exposures. Translation exposures arise from measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Transaction exposures involve impacts from 1) input costs that are denominated in currencies other than the local reporting currency and 2) revaluation of working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. We have experienced significant foreign exchange impacts in the past due to the weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the US dollar, which have negatively impacted net sales, net earnings and cash flows. In response to the devaluation of foreign currencies (including those deemed highly inflationary), any lags or inability (due to government restrictions) to implement price increases or the negative impacts of such actions on product consumption may lead to a decline in our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Commodities and Supply Chain. Our costs are subject to fluctuations due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, inflationary impacts and productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of commodities and input materials directly affects our costs. Disruptions in manufacturing, supply and distribution operations can lead to increased costs. Legal or regulatory requirements and sustainability initiatives may result in increased costs. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may negatively impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may negatively impact our net sales, net earnings and cash flows.\nTEXT: Government Policies. We are exposed to changes in U.S. and foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies that can have a negative impact on net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These include tax policy changes (both U.S. and foreign), including those resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy”. Government controls such as currency exchanges, pricing and import authorizations as well as government policies related to environmental and climate change matters and changes to international trade agreements can also impact our financial performance.\nTEXT: For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.\n"

The primary factors driving year-over-year changes in net sales include overall market growth in the categories in which we compete, product initiatives, competitive activities (the level of initiatives, pricing and other activities by competitors), marketing spending, retail executions (both in-store and online) and acquisition and divestiture activity, all of which drive changes in our underlying unit volume, as well as our pricing actions (which can also impact volume), changes in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impacts on sales outside the U.S.\nTEXT: For most of our categories, our cost of products sold and SG&A are variable in nature to some extent. Accordingly, our discussion of these operating costs focuses primarily on relative margins rather than the absolute year-over-year changes in total costs. The primary drivers of changes in gross margin are input costs (energy and other commodities), pricing impacts, geographic mix (for example, gross margins in North America are generally higher than the Company average for similar products), product mix (for example, the Beauty segment has higher gross margins than the Company average), foreign exchange rate fluctuations (in situations where certain input costs may be tied to a different functional currency than the underlying sales), the impacts of manufacturing savings projects and reinvestments (for example, product or package improvements) and, to a lesser extent, scale impacts (for costs that are fixed or less variable in nature). The primary components of SG&A are marketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead costs. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in nature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some extent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts for these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization and systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The main drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net sales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments (for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign exchange fluctuations and scale impacts.\nTEXT: 20 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: For a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2023 year-over-year changes, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nTITLE: Net Sales\nTEXT: Net sales increased 2% to $84.0 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing of 4%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 2%. Volume and mix were unchanged versus the prior year.\nTEXT: Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Grooming and increased low single digits in Beauty. Net sales were unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%.

The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTEXT: Operating margin was unchanged at 22.1% as the increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and the non-cash impairment charge, as discussed above.\nTEXT: Operating income increased $411 million, or 2%, to $18.5 billion due to the increase in net sales, as discussed above.\nTITLE: Non-Operating Items\nTEXT: •Interest expense was $925 million, an increase of $169 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\nTEXT: •Interest income was $473 million, an increase of $166 million versus the prior year due primarily to higher interest rates.\nTEXT: •Other non-operating income was unchanged at $668 million as gains from the sale of minor brands and an increase in net non-operating benefits on postretirement plans were fully offset by a non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 21\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: The effective income tax rate for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, was 20.2%, compared to 19.7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

On December 5, 2023, the Company announced an incremental limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\nTEXT: In fiscal 2024, the Company incurred before tax restructuring costs of $659 million, which include foreign currency translation losses recognized as a non-cash charge of approximately $216 million due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. Restructuring accruals of $166 million as of June 30, 2024, are classified as current liabilities. Excluding the non-cash charges of foreign currency translation losses for certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, approximately 64% of the restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2024 either have been or will be settled with cash. Consistent with our policies for restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting.\nTEXT: Savings generated from the Company's restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program.\nTITLE: CASH FLOW, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nTEXT: We believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates.\nTEXT: Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends. Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses, brands and geographies. As necessary, we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.

Net earnings, adjusted for certain non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, intangible asset impairment, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets) generated approximately $19.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $533 million of cash in the period primarily driven by an increase in trade payables and other non-cash add-backs, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and a decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals. The increase in trade payables is primarily from increased marketing support activities and extended payment terms with suppliers, partially offset by lower supply chain payables due to a decrease in commodity costs. Other non-cash add-backs include the non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria. The increase in Accounts Receivable is primarily from sales growth. The decrease in post-retirement benefit accruals is due to payments and the net periodic credit from other retiree benefits. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Days inventory on hand increased by two days.\nTEXT: Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP measure because it is a factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow is one of the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.\nTEXT: Adjusted free cash flow was $16.9 billion in 2024, an increase of 21% versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flows as discussed above. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge and non-cash charge for accumulated foreign currency translation losses due to the substantial liquidation of operations in certain Enterprise Markets, including Nigeria, was 105% in 2024.\nTITLE: Investing Cash Flow\nTEXT: Net investing activities used $3.5 billion of cash in 2024, primarily due to capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges.\nTITLE: Financing Cash Flow\nTEXT: Net financing activities used $14.9 billion of cash in 2024, mainly due to dividends to shareholders, treasury stock purchases and a net debt decrease, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other.\nTITLE: Liquidity\nTEXT: At June 30, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $8.9 billion, largely due to accounts payable, short-term borrowings and debt due within one year. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. The Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available sources to fund these needs. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $6.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various European and Asian countries. We did not have material cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the funds. Under current law, we do not expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nTEXT: We utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term financing requirements.\nTEXT: On June 30, 2024, our short-term credit ratings were P-1 (Moody's) and A-1+ (Standard & Poor's), while our long-term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA- (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.\nTEXT: We maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing commercial paper program. The current facility is an $8.0 billion facility split between a $3.2 billion five-year facility and a $4.8 billion 364-day facility, which expire in November 2028 and October 2024, respectively. Both facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as specified in the terms of the credit agreement. These facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn. These credit facilities do not\nTEXT: 26 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: have cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing.

Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nTEXT: In preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nTEXT: The Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\nTITLE: Revenue Recognition\nTEXT: Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\n"

Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.\nTEXT: We operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These interpretational differences with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment.\nTEXT: A core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model, such that profits are earned in line with the business substance and functions of the various legal entities in the jurisdictions where those functions are performed. However, because of the complexity of transfer pricing concepts, we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer prices for our various cross-border transactions. We have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance rulings with tax authorities to reduce this uncertainty. We estimate that our current portfolio of advance rulings reduces this uncertainty with respect to over 70% of our global earnings. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have several audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTEXT: Because there are several estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain future events such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.

These include pension plans, both defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other postretirement benefit (OPRB) plans consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting purposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans require assumptions to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligations, including the following variables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost trend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual expense and net obligations recognized for the underlying plans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount by which actual results differ from our assumptions is deferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the greater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year. The cost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits.\nTEXT: The expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially funded. The process for setting the expected rates of return is described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For 2024, the average return on assets assumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was 6.0% and 8.5%, respectively. A change in the rate of return of 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would impact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately $145 million.\nTEXT: Since pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a discounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan obligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S. defined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality bonds for which the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate the estimated payouts of the plan. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of 4.2% represents a weighted average of local rates in countries where such plans exist. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit expense by approximately $85 million. The average discount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.8% reflects the higher interest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where most of the plan participants receive benefits. A 100 basis-point change in the discount rate would impact annual after-tax OPRB expense by approximately $30 million. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details on our defined benefit pension and OPRB plans.\n"

Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units and intangible assets. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are expected to have\nTEXT: 28 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values.\nTEXT: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\nTEXT: While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\nTEXT: The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\nTEXT: Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rates could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\nTEXT: The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\nTEXT: The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n"

These currency interest rate swaps are designated as hedges of the Company's foreign net investments.\nTEXT: Based on our interest rate exposure as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, including derivative and other instruments sensitive to interest rates, we believe a near-term change in interest rates, at a 95% confidence level based on historical interest rate movements, would not materially affect our financial statements.\nTEXT: Currency Rate Exposure. Because we manufacture and sell products and finance operations in a number of countries throughout the world, we are exposed to movements in currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. Corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity. To manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operations, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps with maturities of less than 18 months.\nTEXT: Based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instruments as of and during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we believe, at a 95% confidence level based on historical currency rate movements, the impact on such instruments of a near-term change in currency rates would not materially affect our financial statements.\nTEXT: Commodity Price Exposure. We use raw materials that are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. We may use futures, options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity.\n"

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.\nTEXT: Strong internal controls is an objective that is reinforced through our Worldwide Business Conduct Manual, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Our people are deeply committed to our Purpose, Values and Principles, which unite us in doing what’s right. Our system of internal controls includes written policies and procedures, segregation of duties and the careful selection and development of employees. Additional key elements of our internal control structure include our Global Leadership Council, which is actively involved in oversight of the business strategies, initiatives, results and controls, our Disclosure Committee, which is responsible for evaluating disclosure implications of significant business activities and events, our Board of Directors, which provides strong and effective corporate governance, and our Audit Committee, which reviews critical accounting policies and estimates, financial reporting and internal control matters.\nTEXT: Global Internal Audit performs audits of internal controls over financial reporting as well as broader financial, operational and compliance audits around the world, provides training and continually improves our internal control processes. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting also includes a robust Control Self-Assessment Program that is conducted annually on critical financial reporting areas of the Company. Management takes the appropriate action to correct any identified control deficiencies.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden or that misstatements due to error or fraud may occur that are not detected.

The Company estimates fair value using the income method, which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective asset. This requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings, including growth rates beyond a 10-year time period, royalty rate and discount rate. Changes in the assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any impairment charge, or both. The Company performed their annual impairment assessment of the Gillette Brand as of October 1, 2023. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the Company determined that the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying amount. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Gillette Brand was $12.8 billion.\nTEXT: We identified the Company’s impairment evaluation of the Gillette Brand as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. A high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort was required when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecasts of future net sales and earnings as well as the selection of royalty rate and discount rate, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.\nTEXT: How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nTEXT: Our audit procedures related to forecasts of future net sales and earnings and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate for the Gillette Brand included the following, among others:\nTEXT: 34 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: •We tested the effectiveness of controls over the Gillette Brand, including those over the determination of fair value, such as controls related to management’s development of forecasts of future net sales and earnings, and the selection of royalty rate and discount rate.\nTEXT: •We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast net sales and earnings by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\nTEXT: •We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecast of net sales and earnings by comparing the forecasts to:\nTEXT: •Historical net sales and earnings.\nTEXT: •Underlying analysis detailing business strategies and growth plans.\nTEXT: •Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.\nTEXT: •Forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies.\nTEXT: •With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rate, and discount rate by:\nTEXT: •Testing the source information underlying the determination of net sales and earnings growth rates, royalty rate, and discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculations.\nTEXT: •Developing a range of independent estimates for the discount rate and comparing the discount rate selected by management to that range.\nTEXT: /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCincinnati, OhioAugust 5, 2024We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1890.\nTABLE: TABLE: .\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 35\n"

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nTEXT: /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPCincinnati, OhioAugust 5, 2024\nTABLE: TABLE: .\nTEXT: 36 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: Consolidated Statements of EarningsAmounts in millions except per share amounts; fiscal years ended June 30202420232022NET SALES$84,039 $82,006 $80,187 Cost of products sold40,848 42,760 42,157 Selling, general and administrative expense23,305 21,112 20,217 Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge1,341 — — OPERATING INCOME18,545 18,134 17,813 Interest expense(925)(756)(439)Interest income473 307 51 Other non-operating income, net668 668 570 EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES18,761 18,353 17,995 Income taxes3,787 3,615 3,202 NET EARNINGS14,974 14,738 14,793 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests95 85 51 NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE$14,879 $14,653 $14,742 NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)Basic$6.18 $6.07 $6.00 Diluted$6.02 $5.90 $5.81\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: NET SALES — 2024: 84,039; 2023: 82,006; 2022: 80,187\nTABLE_ROW: Cost of products sold — 2024: 40,848; 2023: 42,760; 2022: 42,157\nTABLE_ROW: Selling, general and administrative expense — 2024: 23,305; 2023: 21,112; 2022: 20,217\nTABLE_ROW: Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge — 2024: 1,341\nTABLE_ROW: OPERATING INCOME — 2024: 18,545; 2023: 18,134; 2022: 17,813\nTABLE_ROW: Interest expense — 2024: (925); 2023: (756); 2022: (439)\nTABLE_ROW: Interest income — 2024: 473; 2023: 307; 2022: 51\nTABLE_ROW: Other non-operating income, net — 2024: 668; 2023: 668; 2022: 570\nTABLE_ROW: EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES — 2024: 18,761; 2023: 18,353; 2022: 17,995\nTABLE_ROW: Income taxes — 2024: 3,787; 2023: 3,615; 2022: 3,202\nTABLE_ROW: NET EARNINGS — 2024: 14,974; 2023: 14,738; 2022: 14,793\nTABLE_ROW: Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests — 2024: 95; 2023: 85; 2022: 51\nTABLE_ROW: NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE — 2024: 14,879; 2023: 14,653; 2022: 14,742\nTABLE_ROW: Basic — 2024: 6.18; 2023: 6.07; 2022: 6.00\nTABLE_ROW: Diluted — 2024: 6.02; 2023: 5.90; 2022: 5.81\nTITLE: Amounts in millions except per share amounts; fiscal years ended June 30202420232022\nTITLE: Amounts in millions except per share amounts; fiscal years ended June 30\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: NET SALES$84,039 $82,006 $80,187\nTITLE: NET SALES\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 84,039\nTITLE: Cost of products sold40,848 42,760 42,157\nTITLE: 40,848\nTITLE: Selling, general and administrative expense23,305 21,112 20,217\nTITLE: 23,305\nTITLE: Indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge1,341 — —\nTITLE: 1,341\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: OPERATING INCOME18,545 18,134 17,813\nTITLE: OPERATING INCOME\nTITLE: 18,545\nTITLE: Interest expense(925)(756)(439)\nTITLE: (925)\nTITLE: Interest income473 307 51\nTITLE: 473\nTITLE: Other non-operating income, net668 668 570\nTITLE: 668\nTITLE: EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES18,761 18,353 17,995\nTITLE: EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\nTITLE: 18,761\nTITLE: Income taxes3,787 3,615 3,202\nTITLE: 3,787\nTITLE: NET EARNINGS14,974 14,738 14,793\nTITLE: NET EARNINGS\nTITLE: 14,974\nTITLE: Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests95 85 51\nTITLE: 95\nTITLE: NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE$14,879 $14,653 $14,742\nTITLE: NET EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PROCTER & GAMBLE\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 14,879\nTITLE: NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (1)\nTITLE: Basic$6.18 $6.07 $6.00\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 6.18\nTITLE: Diluted$6.02 $5.90 $5.81\nTITLE: $\n"

Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in about 70 countries.\nTITLE: Basis of Presentation\nTEXT: The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions are eliminated.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: Preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions the Company may undertake in the future. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade promotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions, postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and contingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from estimates, although management does not generally believe such differences would materially affect the financial statements in any individual year. However, regarding ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial valuations, could result in impairment charges that materially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n"

Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. A provision for payment discounts and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of sales in the same period the revenue is recognized. The revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities. The revenue includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are included in the list price to the customer.\nTEXT: Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Most of these arrangements have terms of approximately one year. Accruals for expected payouts under these programs are included as accrued marketing and promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Cost of Products Sold\nTEXT: Cost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished products. Cost of products sold also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\nTITLE: Selling, General and Administrative Expense\nTEXT: Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling expenses, research and development costs, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items. Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred and were $2.0 billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include television, print, radio, digital and in-store advertising expenses and were $9.6 billion in 2024, $8.0 billion in 2023 and $7.9 billion in 2022. Non-advertising related components of the Company's total marketing spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\nTITLE: Other Non-Operating Income, Net\nTEXT: Other non-operating income, net primarily includes divestiture gains, net non-service impacts related to postretirement benefit plans, investment income, accumulated foreign currency translation losses and other non-operating items.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 41\nTITLE: Currency Translation\nTEXT: Financial statements of operating subsidiaries outside the U.S. generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. Re-measurement adjustments for financial statements in highly inflationary economies and other transactional exchange gains and losses are reflected in earnings.\nTITLE: Cash Flow Presentation\nTEXT: The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are prepared using the indirect method, which reconciles net earnings to cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from foreign currency transactions and operations are translated at monthly exchange rates for each period. Cash flows from hedging activities are included in the same category as the items being hedged. Cash flows from derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as investing activities. Realized gains and losses from non-qualifying derivative instruments used to hedge currency exposures resulting from intercompany financing transactions are classified as financing activities. Cash flows from other derivative instruments used to manage interest rates, commodity or other currency exposures are classified as operating activities. Cash payments related to income taxes are classified as operating activities.\nTITLE: Investments\nTEXT: The Company holds minor equity investments in certain companies over which we exert significant influence, but do not control the financial and operating decisions. These are accounted for as equity method investments. Other equity investments that are not controlled, and over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, and for which there is a readily determinable market value, are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses recorded through net earnings. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured at cost, less impairments, plus or minus observable price changes. Equity investments are included as Other noncurrent assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTEXT: The Company also holds highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds and time deposits. Such investments are considered cash equivalents and are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Inventory Valuation\nTEXT: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Product-related inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out method. The cost of spare part inventories is maintained using the average-cost method.\n"

Depreciation expense is recognized over the assets' estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Machinery and equipment includes office furniture and fixtures (15-year life), computer equipment and capitalized software (3- to 5-year lives) and manufacturing equipment (3- to 20-year lives). Buildings are depreciated over an estimated useful life of 40 years. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying amounts.\nTITLE: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or more often if indicators of a potential impairment are present. Our annual impairment testing of goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nTEXT: We have acquired brands that have been determined to have indefinite lives. We evaluate several factors to determine whether an indefinite life is appropriate, including the competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. In addition, when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an additional impairment assessment is performed and indefinite-lived assets may be adjusted to a determinable life.\nTEXT: The cost of intangible assets with determinable useful lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed, either on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the estimated periods benefited. Patents, technology and other intangible assets with contractual terms are generally amortized over their respective legal or contractual lives. Customer relationships, brands and other non-contractual intangible assets with determinable lives are amortized over periods generally ranging from 5 to 30 years. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, an impairment assessment is performed and remaining lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted.\nTEXT: For additional details on goodwill and intangible assets see Note 4.\nTITLE: Fair Values of Financial Instruments\nTEXT: Certain financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value. Changes in assumptions or estimation methods could affect the fair value estimates; however, we do not believe any such changes would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Other financial instruments, including cash equivalents, certain investments and certain short-term debt, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 42 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTITLE: New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies\nTEXT: In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025, and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\nTEXT: In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures.\nTEXT: No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital expenditures in the segments are on an accrual basis consistent with the balance sheet. Adjustments to move from an accrual to cash basis, for purposes of the cash flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.\nTEXT: Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities that are not reflected in the operating results used internally to measure and evaluate the businesses, as well as items to adjust management reporting principles to U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating elements also include certain employee benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization, asset impairment charges and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate primarily include interest expense, certain pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture gains, interest and investing income and other financing costs.\nTEXT: Total assets for the reportable segments include those assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets.

Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal.

Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.\nTITLE: Other Costs\nTEXT: Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include accumulated foreign currency translation losses, asset removal and termination of contracts related to Enterprise Market portfolio restructuring.

Goodwill increased during fiscal 2023 primarily due to an acquisition in the Beauty segment, other minor brand acquisitions in the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment and currency translation across all reportable segments.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability). Significant judgment by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows. Estimates utilized in the projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nTEXT: We believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\nTEXT: During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined that the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: 48 The Procter & Gamble Company\nTEXT: Identifiable intangible assets were comprised of:\nTEXT: 20242023As of June 30Gross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationGross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationINTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVESBrands$4,318 $(2,725)$4,352 $(2,540)Patents and technology2,794 (2,683)2,775 (2,649)Customer relationships1,834 (1,121)1,847 (1,039)Other72 (29)73 (28)TOTAL$9,019 $(6,558)$9,047 $(6,256)INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVESBrands19,587 — 20,992 — TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS$28,605 $(6,558)$30,039 $(6,256)\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Brands — 2024: 4,318; 2023: (2,725)\nTABLE_ROW: Patents and technology — 2024: 2,794; 2023: (2,683)\nTABLE_ROW: Customer relationships — 2024: 1,834; 2023: (1,121)\nTABLE_ROW: Other — 2024: 72; 2023: (29)\nTABLE_ROW: TOTAL — 2024: 9,019; 2023: (6,558)\nTABLE_ROW: Brands — 2024: 19,587; 2023: 20,992\nTABLE_ROW: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS — 2024: 28,605; 2023: (6,558)\nTITLE: 20242023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: As of June 30Gross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortizationGross Carrying AmountAccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: As of June 30\nTITLE: Gross Carrying Amount\nTITLE: AccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: Gross Carrying Amount\nTITLE: AccumulatedAmortization\nTITLE: INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DETERMINABLE LIVES\nTITLE: Brands$4,318 $(2,725)$4,352 $(2,540)\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 4,318\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (2,725)\nTITLE: Patents and technology2,794 (2,683)2,775 (2,649)\nTITLE: 2,794\nTITLE: (2,683)\nTITLE: Customer relationships1,834 (1,121)1,847 (1,039)\nTITLE: 1,834\nTITLE: (1,121)\nTITLE: Other72 (29)73 (28)\nTITLE: 72\nTITLE: (29)\nTITLE: TOTAL$9,019 $(6,558)$9,047 $(6,256)\nTITLE: TOTAL\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 9,019\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (6,558)\nTITLE: INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES\nTITLE: Brands19,587 — 20,992 —\nTITLE: 19,587\nTITLE: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS$28,605 $(6,558)$30,039 $(6,256)\nTITLE: TOTAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: 28,605\nTITLE: $\nTITLE: (6,558)\nTITLE: Amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:Fiscal years ended June 30202420232022Intangible asset amortization$338 $327 $312\nTEXT: Amortization expense of intangible assets was as follows:\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202420232022Intangible asset amortization$338 $327 $312\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: Intangible asset amortization — 2024: 338; 2023: 327; 2022: 312\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202420232022Intangible asset amortization$338 $327 $312\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30202420232022\nTITLE: Fiscal years ended June 30\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: Intangible asset amortization$338 $327 $312\nTITLE: $\n"

For the remaining plans, the Company determines these amounts utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the corporate bond yield curve used to measure the plan obligations.\nTEXT: Several factors are considered in developing the estimate for the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets. For the defined benefit retirement plans, these factors include historical rates of return of broad equity and bond indices and projected long-term rates of return obtained from pension investment consultants. The expected long-term rates of return for plan assets are 8 - 9% for equities and 3 - 5% for bonds. For other retiree benefit plans, the expected long-term rate of return reflects that the assets are comprised primarily of Company stock. The expected rate of return on Company stock is based on the long-term projected return of 8.5% and reflects the historical pattern of returns.\nTEXT: Plan Assets. Our investment objective for defined benefit retirement plan assets is to meet the plans' benefit obligations and to improve plan self-sufficiency for future benefit obligations. The investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by assessing different investment risks and matching the actuarial projections of the plans' future liabilities and benefit payments with current as well as expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. Plan assets are diversified across several investment managers and are generally invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market equity and bond indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.\nTEXT: Our target asset allocation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:Target Asset AllocationActual Asset Allocation at June 30Pension BenefitsOther RetireeBenefitsPension BenefitsOther Retiree BenefitsAsset Category2024202320242023Cash1 %2 %2 %1 %2 %2 %Debt securities61 %1 %61 %60 %1 %1 %Equity securities38 %97 %37 %39 %97 %97 %TOTAL100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Target Asset Allocation Actual Asset Allocation at June 30; Pension Benefits Other RetireeBenefits Pension Benefits Other Retiree Benefits; Asset Category 2024 2023 2024 2023; Cash 1 % 2 % 2 % 1 % 2 % 2 %; Debt securities 61 % 1 % 61 % 60 % 1 % 1 %; Equity securities 38 % 97 % 37 % 39 % 97 % 97 %; TOTAL 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 %.\nTITLE: Target Asset AllocationActual Asset Allocation at June 30\nTITLE: Target Asset Allocation\nTITLE: Actual Asset Allocation at June 30\nTITLE: Pension BenefitsOther RetireeBenefitsPension BenefitsOther Retiree Benefits\nTITLE: Pension Benefits\nTITLE: Other RetireeBenefits\nTITLE: Pension Benefits\nTITLE: Other Retiree Benefits\nTITLE: Asset Category2024202320242023\nTITLE: Asset Category\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Cash1 %2 %2 %1 %2 %2 %\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 2\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Debt securities61 %1 %61 %60 %1 %1 %\nTITLE: 61\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 61\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 1\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: Equity securities38 %97 %37 %39 %97 %97 %\nTITLE: 38\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 97\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 37\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 97\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: TOTAL100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %100 %\nTITLE: TOTAL\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTITLE: 100\nTITLE: %\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 57\nTEXT: The following table sets forth the fair value of the Company's plan assets as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, segregated by level within the fair value hierarchy (refer to Note 9 for further discussion on the fair value hierarchy and fair value principles).

We evaluate exposures on a centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting. To the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposures, we enter into various financial transactions that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. These financial transactions are governed by our policies covering acceptable counterparty exposure, instrument types and other hedging practices.\nTEXT: If the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets certain specified accounting criteria, management designates derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. We record derivative instruments at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge. We generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument.\n"

Counterparty exposures are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit ratings are reviewed on a timely basis. We have not incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on our risk management or other financial instruments.\nTEXT: Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $307 and $1,088 as of June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features.\nTITLE: Interest Rate Risk Management\nTEXT: Our policy is to manage interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. To manage this risk in a cost-efficient manner, we enter into interest rate swaps whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a notional amount.\nTEXT: We designate certain interest rate swaps on fixed rate debt that meet specific accounting criteria as fair value hedges. For fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\nTEXT: The Procter & Gamble Company 59\nTITLE: Foreign Currency Risk Management\nTEXT: We manufacture and sell our products and finance our operations in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We leverage the Company’s diversified portfolio of exposures as a natural hedge. In certain cases, we enter into non-qualifying foreign currency contracts to hedge certain balance sheet items subject to revaluation. The change in fair value of these instruments and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings.\nTEXT: To manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing, we primarily use forward contracts and currency swaps. The change in fair value of these non-qualifying instruments is immediately recognized in earnings, substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark-to-market impact of the related exposure.\nTITLE: Net Investment Hedging\nTEXT: We hedge certain net investment positions in foreign subsidiaries. To accomplish this, we either borrow directly in foreign currencies and designate all or a portion of the foreign currency debt as a hedge of the applicable net investment position or we enter into foreign currency swaps that are designated as hedges of net investments. The time value component of the net investment hedge currency swaps is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. Changes in the fair value of the swap, including changes in the fair value of the excluded time value component, are recognized in OCI and offset the value of the net investment being hedged. The time value component is subsequently reported in income on a systematic basis.\nTITLE: Commodity Risk Management\nTEXT: Certain raw materials used in our products or production processes are subject to price volatility caused by weather, supply conditions, political and economic variables and other unpredictable factors. As of and during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any financial commodity hedging activity.\nTITLE: Insurance\nTEXT: We self-insure for most insurable risks. However, we purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and certain other coverage where it is required by law or by contract.\nTITLE: Fair Value Hierarchy\nTEXT: Accounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following categories:\nTEXT: •Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nTEXT: •Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nTEXT: •Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity's own assumptions or external inputs from inactive markets.\nTEXT: The Company had no significant activity with Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the periods presented. When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the year.\nTEXT: When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value.\n"

We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate.

These amounts include purchase commitments related to service contracts for information technology, human resources management and facilities management activities that have been outsourced to third-party suppliers. Due to the proprietary nature of many of our materials and processes, certain supply contracts contain penalty provisions for early termination. We do not expect to incur penalty payments under these provisions that would materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTITLE: Litigation\nTEXT: We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTEXT: We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTITLE: SUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMS\nTEXT: The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $5.6 billion as of June 30, 2024 and $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n"
