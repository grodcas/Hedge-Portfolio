Basis of Presentation\nTEXT: UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\nTEXT: The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 as filed with the SEC (2024 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods. The impact of any change in estimates is included in earnings in the period in which the estimate is adjusted.\nTITLE: Revenues - Products and Services\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, accounts receivable related to products and services were $9.8 billion and $9.9 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2025, revenue expected to be recognized in any future year related to remaining performance obligations, excluding revenue pertaining to contracts having an original expected duration of one year or less, contracts where revenue is recognized as invoiced and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations, was $11.9 billion, of which approximately half is expected to be recognized in the next three years.\nTITLE: 2.

The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of June 30, 2025, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary. The allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was not material.\nTITLE: 3.

The total anticipated capital required for these acquisitions, excluding the payoff of acquired indebtedness, was approximately $4 billion.\nTITLE: Legal Matters\nTEXT: The Company is frequently made party to a variety of legal actions and regulatory inquiries, including class actions and suits brought by members, care providers, consumer advocacy organizations, customers, shareholders, and regulators, relating to the Company’s businesses, including management and administration of health benefit plans and other services. These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.\nTEXT: The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.\nTITLE: Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews\nTEXT: The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS and OIG have selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.\nTEXT: On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. In March 2025, a Special Master appointed by the court issued a report recommending that the court enter summary judgment in the Company’s favor on all remaining claims. In April 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to reject the Special Master’s report. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.\nTITLE: 8.

We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\nTEXT: Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, the mix and health status of people served, inflation and labor market dynamics. For 2025, our pricing trends and patient and member health status assumptions were well-short of the medical cost trends incurred, significantly impacting our earnings. We continually evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We seek to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\nTEXT: The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs. Continued increased medical costs may impact both future pricing and benefit design, including for our individual exchange products in markets we choose to remain, and result in shifts between product categories for our employer benefits. These potential changes, along with certain regulatory impacts, may result in decreased membership in future periods.\nTEXT: Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends,” which may impact pricing and benefit design in future periods.\nTEXT: Optum Health’s fully accountable value-based care businesses have been impacted by Medicare funding reductions and have also seen continued medical cost trend pressures, which may impact future pricing in the markets we continue to participate.\nTEXT: The Medicaid redetermination process has caused a timing mismatch between the health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates. Due to elevated care activity, specifically related to behavioral, pharmacy and home health, there continues to be a mismatch between the updated rates in 2025 and underlying member acuity. The funding and payment rate environment remains insufficient to meet the health needs of patients and creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs. Additionally, we expect some Medicaid membership losses in 2026 as a result of early adoption of recent legislation.\nTEXT: Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. We have observed increased care patterns, more notably related to physician and outpatient care, and to a lesser extent inpatient and emergency room utilization, that are above what we expected and contemplated in our pricing and benefits design. We have also observed an increase in health care unit costs and the intensity of services delivered, driven by increases in provider pricing and additional services bundled per visit. Additionally, the member profile of newly added patients under value-based care arrangements, people served in Medicare Advantage in markets where other plans exited, and peopled served within our individual exchange business has contributed to increased medical costs. These trends may continue in future periods.\nTEXT: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) altered the Medicare Part D model and benefits, shifting more risk to plans, which results in both increased premiums and medical costs. The IRA also changed the quarterly relationship of medical costs to premiums, altering the seasonal progression and creating a more consistent relationship between medical costs and premiums throughout the year.\nTEXT: We endeavor to mitigate medical cost increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care. Additionally, we have elevated our audit, clinical policy and payment integrity tools to protect customers and patients from unnecessary costs.\n"

Medicare Advantage rate notices for numerous years have resulted in industry base rates well below the industry forward medical cost trend, with the Final Notice for 2026 beginning to approach the industry forward medical cost trend. Additionally, increased medical costs in 2025, which are significantly above initial cost trend estimates, adds to the compounding impact of the previous multi-year rate shortfalls creating sustained pressure on the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, have and will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\nTEXT: As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\nTITLE: SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS\nTEXT: The following summarizes select second quarter 2025 year-over-year operating comparisons to second quarter 2024 and other financial results.\nTEXT: •Consolidated revenues grew 13%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 17% and Optum revenues grew 7%.\nTEXT: •UnitedHealthcare served 1.0 million more people, driven by growth in Medicare Advantage and commercial offerings.\nTEXT: •Consolidated earnings from operations of $5.2 billion compared to $7.9 billion last year, with 2025 impacted by elevated medical cost trend and 2024 impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\nTEXT: •Diluted earnings per common share was $3.74.\nTEXT: •Cash flows from operations for the six months ended June 30, 2025 were $12.6 billion.\n"

The metrics also allow management and investors to evaluate and understand business mix, including the level and scope of services provided to people, and pricing trends when comparing the metrics to revenue by segment.\nTEXT: The following table presents a summary of the reportable segment financial information: Three Months EndedJune 30,Increase/(Decrease)Six Months Ended June 30,Increase/(Decrease)(in millions, except percentages)202520242025 vs. 2024202520242025 vs. 2024RevenuesUnitedHealthcare$86,103 $73,866 $12,23717 %$170,720 $149,223 $21,497 14 %Optum Health25,205 27,050 (1,845)(7)50,514 53,781 (3,267)(6)Optum Insight4,828 4,543 2856 9,458 9,045 413 5 Optum Rx38,459 32,415 6,04419 73,591 63,250 10,341 16 Optum eliminations(1,267)(1,129)(138)12 (2,453)(2,145)(308)14 Optum67,225 62,879 4,3467 131,110 123,931 7,179 6 Eliminations(41,712)(37,890)(3,822)10 (80,639)(74,503)(6,136)8 Consolidated revenues$111,616 $98,855 $12,76113 %$221,191 $198,651 $22,540 11 %Earnings from operationsUnitedHealthcare$2,075 $4,004 $(1,929)(48)%$7,301 $8,399 $(1,098)(13)%Optum Health636 1,919 (1,283)(67)2,250 3,818 (1,568)(41)Optum Insight998 546 452 83 1,959 1,036 923 89 Optum Rx1,441 1,406 35 2 2,759 2,553 206 8 Optum3,075 3,871 (796)(21)6,968 7,407 (439)(6)Consolidated earnings from operations$5,150 $7,875 $(2,725)(35)%$14,269 $15,806 $(1,537)(10)%Operating marginUnitedHealthcare2.4 %5.4 %(3.0)%4.3 %5.6 %(1.3)%Optum Health2.5 7.1 (4.6)4.5 7.1 (2.6)Optum Insight20.7 12.0 8.7 20.7 11.5 9.2 Optum Rx3.7 4.3 (0.6)3.7 4.0 (0.3)Optum4.6 6.2 (1.6)5.3 6.0 (0.7)Consolidated operating margin4.6 %8.0 %(3.4)%6.5 %8.0 %(1.5)%\nTABLE: TABLE: Three Months EndedJune 30, Increase/(Decrease) Six Months Ended June 30, Increase/(Decrease); (in millions, except percentages) 2025 2024 2025 vs. 2024 2025 2024 2025 vs. 2024; UnitedHealthcare $ 86,103 $ 73,866 $ 12,237 17 % $ 170,720 $ 149,223 $ 21,497 14 %; Optum Health 25,205 27,050 (1,845) (7) 50,514 53,781 (3,267) (6); Optum Insight 4,828 4,543 285 6 9,458 9,045 413 5; Optum Rx 38,459 32,415 6,044 19 73,591 63,250 10,341 16; Optum eliminations (1,267) (1,129) (138) 12 (2,453) (2,145) (308) 14; Optum 67,225 62,879 4,346 7 131,110 123,931 7,179 6; Eliminations (41,712) (37,890) (3,822) 10 (80,639) (74,503) (6,136) 8; Consolidated revenues $ 111,616 $ 98,855 $ 12,761 13 % $ 221,191 $ 198,651 $ 22,540 11 %; UnitedHealthcare $ 2,075 $ 4,004 $ (1,929) (48) % $ 7,301 $ 8,399 $ (1,098) (13) %; Optum Health 636 1,919 (1,283) (67) 2,250 3,818 (1,568) (41); Optum Insight 998 546 452 83 1,959 1,036 923 89; Optum Rx 1,441 1,406 35 2 2,759 2,553 206 8; Optum 3,075 3,871 (796) (21) 6,968 7,407 (439) (6); Consolidated earnings from operations $ 5,150 $ 7,875 $ (2,725) (35) % $ 14,269 $ 15,806 $ (1,537) (10) %; UnitedHealthcare 2.4 % 5.4 % (3.0) % 4.3 % 5.6 % (1.3) %; Optum Health 2.5 7.1 (4.6) 4.5 7.1 (2.6); Optum Insight 20.7 12.0 8.7 20.7 11.5 9.2; Optum Rx 3.7 4.3 (0.6) 3.7 4.0 (0.3); Optum 4.6 6.2 (1.6) 5.3 6.0 (0.7); Consolidated operating margin 4.6 % 8.0 % (3.4) % 6.5 % 8.0 % (1.5) %.\nTITLE: Three Months EndedJune 30,Increase/(Decrease)Six Months Ended June 30,Increase/(Decrease)\nTITLE: Three Months EndedJune 30,\nTITLE: Increase/(Decrease)\nTITLE: Six Months Ended June 30,\nTITLE: Increase/(Decrease)\nTITLE: (in millions, except percentages)202520242025 vs. 2024202520242025 vs. 2024\nTITLE: (in millions, except percentages)\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025 vs. 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2025 vs. 2024\nTITLE: Revenues\nTITLE: Earnings from operations\nTITLE: Operating margin\n"

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, decreased cash paid for acquisitions and increased net sales and maturities of investments, offset by decreased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, increased share repurchases and decreased customer funds administered.\nTITLE: Financial Condition\nTEXT: As of June 30, 2025, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities balances of $77.3 billion included approximately $28.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $3.3 billion was available for general corporate use), $46.6 billion of debt securities and $2.1 billion of investments in marketable equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.3 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of June 30, 2025. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\n"

Actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors including: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage medical costs; new or changes in existing health care laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application; cyberattacks, other privacy/data security incidents, or our failure to comply with related regulations; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under government programs; changes in Medicare, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; the DOJ’s legal actions concerning our participation in the Medicare program; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in quality scores impacting revenue; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; risks and uncertainties associated with our businesses providing pharmacy care services; competitive pressures, including our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements; failure to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers; the impact of potential changes in tax laws and regulations; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to complete, manage or integrate strategic transactions; risk and uncertainties associated with the sale of our remaining operations in South America; risks associated with public health crises arising from large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, natural disasters and other extreme events; failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives; our investment portfolio performance; impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets; failure to protect proprietary rights to our databases, software and related products; downgrades in our credit ratings; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or from external financings to fund our obligations, reinvest in our business, maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle, or continue repurchasing shares of our common stock.\nTEXT: This above list is not exhaustive. We discuss these matters, and certain risks that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, more fully in our filings with the SEC, including our reports on Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake to update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nTITLE: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities (a)\n"
