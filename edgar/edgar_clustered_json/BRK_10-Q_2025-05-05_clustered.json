Our significant accounting policies and practices were presented as Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report. Financial information in this Quarterly Report reflects all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of results for the interim periods in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). For several reasons, our results for interim periods may not be indicative of results to be expected for the year. The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses incurred by insurance subsidiaries and the estimation error inherent to the process of determining liabilities for unpaid losses of insurance subsidiaries can be more significant to results of interim periods than to results for a full year. Changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities and the related changes in unrealized gains and losses will produce significant volatility in our interim and annual earnings. In addition, gains and losses from the periodic revaluation of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and asset impairment charges may cause significant variations in periodic net earnings.Significant estimates are used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, including those associated with evaluations of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on the amounts owed to us and the estimation of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts. These estimates may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods. Changes in macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, including changes in international trade policies and tariffs, may negatively affect our operating results and the values of our investments in equity securities and of our operating businesses. We are currently unable to reliably predict the nature, timing or magnitude of the potential economic consequences of any such changes or the impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements.

New accounting and financial reporting pronouncements In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09, “Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-09”), which provides for additional income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures in annual financial statements. ASU 2023-09 may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (“ASU 2024-03”), which requires detailed disclosure in the notes to the financial statements of specific categories underlying certain expense captions on the income statement. ASU 2024-03 may be adopted prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the impacts these pronouncements will have on disclosures in our Consolidated Financial Statements.On March 6, 2024, the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission (“SEC”) issued Release No. 33-11275 and No. 34-99678 “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors” (“Climate Disclosure Rules”). On April 4, 2024, the SEC stayed implementation of the Climate Disclosure Rules, pending the completion of an ongoing judicial review.

Investments in equity securitiesOur investments in equity securities over the years have been concentrated in relatively few companies. The fair value of our five largest holdings at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 represented 69% and 71%, respectively, of the aggregate fair value of our equity securities shown in the preceding tables. The five largest holdings at each date were American Express Company, Apple Inc., Bank of America Corporation, The Coca-Cola Company and Chevron Corporation.Since 2019, we have also owned non-voting Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) and Occidental common stock warrants. Our investments in the Occidental preferred stock and Occidental common stock warrants are recorded at fair value and included as equity securities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as such investments are not in-substance common stock under GAAP. We account for our investment in Occidental common stock under the equity method. See Note 5.The Occidental preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in 2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation value. As of March 31, 2025, our investment in Occidental preferred stock had an aggregate liquidation value of approximately $8.5 billion. To date, Occidental has been required to redeem approximately $1.5 billion of the aggregate liquidation value due to excess distributions by Occidental to its common stockholders, as defined under the terms of the Occidental preferred stock certificate of designations.The Occidental common stock warrants allow us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 per share. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year after the date the preferred stock is fully redeemed. As of March 31, 2025, we owned 151.6 million shares of American Express Company (“American Express”) common stock representing 21.6% of the outstanding common stock of American Express. Since 1995, we have been party to an agreement with American Express whereby we agreed to vote a significant portion of our shares in accordance with the recommendations of the American Express Board of Directors. We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock, and we continue to record our investment at fair value. Note 5. Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain entities that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method. The most significant of these are our investments in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“Kraft Heinz”) and Occidental. As of March 31, 2025, we owned 27.3% of the outstanding Kraft Heinz common stock and 28.2% of the outstanding Occidental common stock which excludes the potential effect of the exercise of Occidental’s outstanding common stock warrants. Kraft Heinz manufactures and markets food and beverage products, including condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Occidental is an international energy company, whose activities include oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and chemicals manufacturing businesses. We also own a 50% interest in Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (“Berkadia”). Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owns the other 50% interest. Berkadia engages in mortgage banking, investment sales and servicing commercial/multi-family real estate loans. Berkadia’s commercial paper borrowing capacity (limited to $1.5 billion) is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligated to indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy.

Equity method investmentsKraft Heinz and Occidental common stocks are publicly traded. As of March 31, 2025, the excess of the carrying values over the fair values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Occidental was 27% and 24%, respectively, of the carrying values of each investment. We evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment as of March 31, 2025. For each investment, we considered our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value exceeds carrying value, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value, the operating results and financial condition of the company, as well as other factors. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required as of March 31, 2025. As of March 31, 2025, the carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximated our share of shareowners’ equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of December 31, 2024 by approximately $9.9 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill.

These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 0.1% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2024.Our primary insurance businesses recorded net increases in prior accident years’ estimated ultimate claim liabilities of $167 million in the first quarter of 2025, primarily attributable to increased loss estimates for casualty exposures, partly offset by lower loss estimates for property coverages. Our primary insurance businesses reduced estimated losses for prior accident years in the first quarter of 2024 by $248 million, which derived primarily from lower estimates for medical professional liability and property coverages. Our reinsurance businesses recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years in the first quarter of $330 million in 2025 and $386 million in 2024. These reductions were primarily attributable to lower estimates for property coverages. Note 14. Retroactive reinsurance contracts Retroactive reinsurance policies provide indemnification of losses and loss adjustment expenses of short-duration insurance contracts with respect to underlying loss events that occurred prior to the contract inception date. Exposures include significant asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims.

Berkshire repaid approximately $1.3 billion of maturing debt in the first quarter of 2025. In April 2025, Berkshire issued ¥90 billion ($632 million) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 and a weighted average interest rate of 1.637% and repaid ¥41.6 billion ($289 million) of senior notes that matured.\nTEXT: Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. Berkshire also guarantees certain debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $2.7 billion at March 31, 2025. Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee for the full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.\nTEXT: The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€4.85 billion, £1.75 billion and ¥1,988 billion par at March 31, 2025) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the period on these borrowings are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Changes in the exchange rates produced pre-tax losses of $936 million in the first quarter of 2025 and pre-tax gains of $781 million in the first quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: Notes payable and other borrowings of our railroad, utilities and energy businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).

Fair value measurementsThe fair values of substantially all of our financial instruments were measured using market or income approaches. The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities. Reconciliations of significant assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) follow (in millions).

Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The program allows share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase program does not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the program. There were no treasury shares acquired during the first quarter of 2025.Note 19. Income taxes Our consolidated effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2025 was 9.2% compared to 18.3% in the first quarter of 2024. Our effective income tax rate normally reflects recurring benefits from dividends-received deductions applicable to investments in certain equity securities and production tax credits related to wind-powered electricity generation placed in service in the U.S. Our periodic effective income tax rate will also vary due to the changes in mix of pre-tax earnings, including realized and unrealized investment gains or losses with respect to our investments in equity securities, the amount of non-deductible goodwill impairment charges and other expenses and the underlying income tax rates applicable in the various taxing jurisdictions. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a global minimum tax of 15%. While the U.S. has not adopted the Pillar Two rules, various countries are enacting legislation to adopt the rules. We do not currently have material operations in jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and we do not currently expect these rules will materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two rules. Note 20.

These wildfires spread across certain parts of PacifiCorp’s service territory and surrounding areas across multiple counties in Oregon and California, including Siskiyou County, California; Jackson County, Oregon; Douglas County, Oregon; Marion County, Oregon; Lincoln County, Oregon; and Klamath County, Oregon, burning over 500,000 acres in aggregate and included the Santiam Canyon, Beachie Creek, South Obenchain, Echo Mountain Complex, 242, Archie Creek, Slater and other fires. The Slater fire occurred in both Oregon and California. Third-party reports for these wildfires (the “2020 Wildfires”) indicate over 2,000 structures destroyed, including residences; several other structures damaged; multiple individuals injured; and several fatalities. A significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred on federal and state lands in connection with certain of the 2020 Wildfires. In December 2024, the United States of America filed a complaint against PacifiCorp in conjunction with the correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil cover sheet accompanying the complaint demands damages estimated to exceed $900 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims. Amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximate $51 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages or punitive damages included in the complaints. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount. Of the $51 billion, $48 billion represents the economic and noneconomic damages sought in the James mass complaints described below. Oregon law provides for doubling of economic and property damages in the event the defendant is found to have acted with gross negligence, recklessness, willfulness or malice. Oregon law provides for trebling of damages associated with timber, shrubs and produce in the event the defendant is determined to have willfully and intentionally trespassed.The 2020 wildfires and 2022 wildfire discussed below are referred to as the “Wildfires.” Based on available information to date, we believe it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. Investigations into the cause and origin of each of the 2020 Wildfires are complex and ongoing and have been or are being conducted by various entities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service (“USFS”), the California Public Utilities Commission, the Oregon Department of Forestry (“ODF”), the Oregon Department of Justice, PacifiCorp and various experts engaged by PacifiCorp.\nTITLE: 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\n"

Business segment data Berkshire’s numerous and diverse businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. These businesses are aggregated into operating segments in a manner that reflects how Berkshire views the business activities. The tabular information that follows shows data of Berkshire’s reportable business segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when those transactions are considered in assessing the results of the respective segments. Furthermore, investment gains and losses, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments and amortization of certain acquisition accounting adjustments or certain other corporate income and expense items are not considered in assessing the financial performance of operating businesses. Collectively, these items are included in corporate, eliminations and other to reconcile segment totals to consolidated amounts. The information in the following tables includes additional disclosures pursuant to ASU 2023-07, which we adopted as of December 31, 2024.We view our insurance segment as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.

The pace of changes in these events, including international trade policies and tariffs, has accelerated in 2025. Considerable uncertainty remains as to the ultimate outcome of these events. We are currently unable to reliably predict the potential impact on our businesses, whether through changes in product costs, supply chain costs and efficiency, and customer demand for our products and services. It is reasonably possible there could be adverse consequences on most, if not all, of our operating businesses, as well as on our investments in equity securities, which could significantly affect our future results.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting after-tax earnings decreased $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Underwriting results in the first quarter of 2025 included after-tax losses from the Southern California wildfires of approximately $860 million. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $295 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to higher interest income from investments in U.S. Treasury Bills, partially offset by lower dividend income.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF increased 6.2% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024 from higher volumes and overall improved operating efficiencies, despite the negative impacts of severe weather in February 2025. After-tax earnings of BHE increased $380 million (53.0%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from the utilities and energy businesses, lower earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests and reduced losses from the real estate brokerage businesses, primarily due to the impact of litigation settlement charges in the first quarter of 2024.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased slightly in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Earnings in 2025 reflected an overall increase from our service and retailing businesses and an overall decrease from our manufacturing businesses. The majority of our businesses experienced lower revenues and earnings in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024.\nTEXT: Investment gains (losses) predominantly derive from our investments in equity securities and include significant unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices and foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of our investments. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings.\nTEXT: Other earnings include corporate investment income, earnings from equity method investments and foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses related to the non-U.S. denominated debt of Berkshire and BHFC.

Net earnings increased $52 million (13.8%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, reflecting comparative increases in electric utility margin (operating revenue less cost of sales) and income tax benefits from recognized wind production tax credits ($40 million), partially offset by an increase in energy operating expenses and lower other income.\nTEXT: The U.S. utilities’ electric utility margin was $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of $225 million (13.2%) compared to 2024. The increase reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories, higher retail customer volumes and higher wholesale prices and volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs. Retail customer volumes increased 4.2% overall (up 11.3% at MEC, 2.4% at PacifiCorp and 0.8% at NV Energy) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily due to an overall favorable impact of weather and an increase in the average number of customers. The increase in energy operating expenses was primarily due to depreciation and amortization expense, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs.\nTEXT: Net earnings of natural gas pipelines decreased $11 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The decrease in earnings reflected higher interest expense, largely due to debt issued in January 2025 and debt refinancings in the fourth quarter of 2024 at higher interest rates, decreased margin on gas sales and lower other income, partially offset by higher transportation and storage revenues.\nTEXT: Net earnings of other energy businesses increased $65 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid, from higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments, partially offset by an income tax charge related to the March 2025 enactment of a change in the Energy Profits Levy income tax in the United Kingdom.\nTEXT: Net losses of real estate brokerage decreased by $144 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to charges in 2024 with respect to the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries and effectuate a nationwide class settlement. See Note 22 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The real estate brokerage business continues to be negatively impacted by the availability of homes for sale and high home prices.\nTEXT: Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings include BHE corporate interest expense and unallocated corporate and income tax expenses.

PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 40.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the first quarter of 2024. The improved results reflect sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies, partly offset by charges and expenses associated with a fire at a fasteners facility in the first quarter of 2025.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 4.7% compared to 2024. The decline was attributable to lower volumes and selling prices, partially offset by favorable product mix. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings declined 25.8% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to restructuring charges in 2025 and lower volumes and selling prices, partially offset by lower raw material costs.\nTEXT: Marmon’s revenues were $3.1 billion in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 3.4% compared to 2024. Seven of the twelve business groups generated higher revenues led by the Rail & Leasing group (17.5%), attributable to higher average lease rates and higher repair rates and volumes. Additionally, revenues increased in the Water Technologies (7.6%) and Foodservice Technologies (9.5%) groups, primarily due to volume increases, while revenues increased in the Electrical (6.8%) and Plumbing & Refrigeration (5.9%) groups, primarily attributable to copper price increases. The largest revenue declines were experienced by the Metal Services (13.2%) and Retail Solutions (25.2%) groups, reflecting a combination of reduced volumes and lower steel prices.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings declined 2.4% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. Seven of Marmon’s business groups reported lower earnings, primarily driven by the Electrical group due to lower margins in the building wire business and soft demand in the utilities market. Additionally, earnings declined in the Metal Services and Retail Solutions groups due to lower revenues. These earnings decreases were partially offset by earnings increases in the Water Technologies, Plumbing & Refrigeration and Transportation Products groups. The impact of higher revenues in the Rail & Leasing group was largely offset by increased maintenance costs on tank cars requiring regulatory inspection and maintenance procedures and reduced gains from asset sales.\nTEXT: IMC’s revenues were $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2025, a decrease of 3.3% compared to the first quarter of 2024. The decline reflected lower organic sales attributable to sluggish customer demand across all major regions, unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar and lower investment income, partially offset by the impact of business acquisitions. The decline in organic sales was attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 18.7% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, primarily attributable to lower sales and gross margin rates and lower investment and other income. IMC operates globally and a large portion of its products are manufactured in Israel.

Financial services revenues in the first quarter of 2025 increased 14.7% compared to 2024, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $27.6 billion as of March 31, 2025, an increase of 12.2% since March 31, 2024. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes declined $23 million (5.0%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024, attributable to lower earnings from financial services, partially offset by higher earnings from manufacturing and site-building activities. The decrease in earnings from financial services earnings was primarily attributable to increases in interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates and losses from homeowner property insurance claims. Interest expense increased $99 million (71.3%) in 2025 versus 2024, as borrowings from affiliates increased $6.6 billion to $24.6 billion at March 31, 2025 compared to March 31, 2024. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page 43.

Revenue increases were generated by Forest River and Brooks Sports, reflecting overall higher volumes and sales mix changes, as well as from Richline, primarily due to the passthrough of higher metals costs. These increases were more than offset by revenue declines across the rest of the businesses, including Jazwares, Fruit of the Loom, Duracell and Garan, primarily due to lower customer demand.\nTEXT: Pre-tax earnings of our consumer products group declined $105 million (29.6%) in the first quarter of 2025 compared to 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower earnings from Forest River, due to higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and from Garan, Jazwares and Duracell, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes and average gross margin rates. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings from Brooks Sports, attributable to increased revenues and gross margin rates, and Fruit of the Loom, attributable to lower manufacturing costs and the benefits of restructuring efforts.\nTITLE: Manufacturing, Service and Retailing\nTEXT: A summary of revenues and pre-tax earnings of our service and retailing businesses follows (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE: 2025 2024; Service $ 5,493 $ 5,151; Retailing 4,644 4,552; Pilot 10,430 12,503; McLane 12,175 12,475; $ 32,742 $ 34,681; Service $ 648 $ 591; Retailing 293 317; Pilot 168 70; McLane 181 165; $ 1,290 $ 1,143; Service 11.8 % 11.5 %; Retailing 6.3 7.0; Pilot 1.6 0.6; McLane 1.5 1.3.\nTITLE: First Quarter\nTITLE: 2025 2024\nTITLE: 2025\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: Revenues\nTITLE: Pre-tax earnings\n"

Revenues from TTI in the first quarter of 2025 increased slightly versus 2024.

Berkshire’s outstanding debt at March 31, 2025 was $20.6 billion, a decline of approximately $500 million since December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire repaid approximately $1.3 billion of maturing debt. Additionally, the carrying value of Berkshire's non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt increased $809 million in the first quarter of 2025 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTEXT: Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $18.0 billion at March 31, 2025, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2024. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal and interest.\nTEXT: BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.5 billion as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. BHE’s aggregate borrowings were approximately $58.0 billion at March 31, 2025, an increase of $1.6 billion from December 31, 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, BHE subsidiaries issued $2.4 billion of term debt, with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% and maturity dates ranging from 2035 to 2055, and BHE and its subsidiaries repaid term debt and short-term borrowings aggregating approximately $890 million. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries or affiliates.\nTEXT: In the first quarter of 2025, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of $10.9 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $4.3 billion in the first quarter of 2025, which included capital expenditures by BNSF and BHE of $2.8 billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and regularly make significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. Forecasted capital expenditures for BHE and BNSF over the remainder of 2025 are approximately $11.9 billion.\nTITLE: Contractual Obligations\nTEXT: We are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments to counterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as borrowings, operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities.\nTEXT: We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty contracts issued by our insurance subsidiaries, including amounts from retroactive reinsurance. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from any forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. Except as otherwise disclosed in this Quarterly Report, our contractual obligations as of March 31, 2025 were, in the aggregate, not materially different from those disclosed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” contained in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n"

Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. Reference is made to “Critical Accounting Estimates” discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in Berkshire’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2025 included estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts of $149.1 billion. Due to the inherent uncertainties in the processes of establishing these liabilities, the actual ultimate claim amounts will likely differ from the currently recorded amounts. A very small percentage change in estimates of this magnitude can result in a material effect on periodic earnings. The effects from changes in these estimates are recorded as a component of insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the period of the change.\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2025 included goodwill of acquired businesses of $84.0 billion and indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.9 billion. In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, our estimated fair values of seven reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our estimated aggregate fair value of these units at that time was approximately $65.6 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value of approximately $57.4 billion. Goodwill of these reporting units totaled approximately $18.6 billion.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of the reporting units and of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods and inputs may be used to estimate fair values, and significant judgments are required in making such estimates. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts.\nTEXT: As of March 31, 2025, we concluded it was more likely than not that goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet were not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on changes in market and economic conditions and events affecting our businesses, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the future.\nTEXT: Information concerning accounting pronouncements to be adopted in the future is included in Note 2 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.\n"

Forward-looking statements include statements which are predictive in nature, which depend upon or refer to future events or conditions, or which include words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” or similar expressions. In addition, any statements concerning future financial performance (including future revenues, earnings or growth rates), ongoing business strategies or prospects and possible future Berkshire actions, which may be provided by management, are also forward-looking statements as defined by the Act. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about Berkshire and its subsidiaries, economic and market factors and the industries in which we do business, among other things. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and we have no specific intention to update these statements.\nTEXT: Actual events and results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. The principal risk factors that could cause our actual performance and future events and actions to differ materially from such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities; the occurrence of one or more catastrophic events, such as an earthquake, hurricane, geopolitical conflict, act of terrorism or cyber-attack that causes losses insured by our insurance subsidiaries and/or losses to our business operations; the frequency and severity of epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, and other events that negatively affect our operating results and restrict our access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates; changes in laws or regulations affecting our insurance, railroad, utilities and energy and finance subsidiaries; changes in federal income tax laws; and changes in general economic and market factors that affect the prices of securities or the industries in which we do business.\nTEXT: Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class B shares any time that Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. Repurchases may be in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. No Class A or Class B shares were repurchased in the first quarter of 2025.\nTABLE: TABLE: Period Total number ofshares purchased Average pricepaid per share Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publiclyannounced program Maximum number orvalue of shares that yetmay be repurchasedunder the program; January — $ — — *; February — — — *; March — — — *.\nTITLE: Period\nTITLE: Total number ofshares purchased\nTITLE: Average pricepaid per share\nTITLE: Total number ofshares purchasedas part of publiclyannounced program\nTITLE: Maximum number orvalue of shares that yetmay be repurchasedunder the program\nTEXT: * The program does not specify a maximum number of shares to be repurchased or obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is no expiration date to the repurchase program. Berkshire will not repurchase its common stock if the repurchases reduce the value of Berkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to less than $30 billion.\n"
