Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a range of amounts can be reasonably estimated and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, then the minimum of the range is accrued. The Corporation does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For purposes of our contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters, as well as other matters which management believes should be disclosed.\nTEXT: State and local governments and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States and its territories have filed a number of legal proceedings against several oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting unprecedented legal and equitable relief for various alleged injuries purportedly connected to climate change. These lawsuits assert a variety of novel, untested claims under statutory and common law. Additional such lawsuits may be filed. We believe the legal and factual theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless and represent an inappropriate attempt to use the court system to usurp the proper role of policymakers in addressing the societal challenges of climate change.\nTEXT: Local governments in Louisiana have filed unprecedented legal proceedings against a number of oil and gas companies, including ExxonMobil, requesting compensation for the restoration of coastal marsh erosion in the state. We believe the factual and legal theories set forth in these proceedings are meritless.\nTEXT: While the outcome of any litigation can be unpredictable, we believe the likelihood is remote that the ultimate outcomes of these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. We will continue to defend vigorously against these claims.\nTITLE: Other Contingencies\nTEXT: The Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at September 30, 2024, for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts. Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence.\nTEXT: September 30, 2024 (millions of dollars)Equity CompanyObligations (1)Other Third-Party ObligationsTotalGuarantees Debt-related1,092 138 1,230 Other676 6,158 6,834 Total1,768 6,296 8,064 (1) ExxonMobil share\nTABLE: TABLE: (millions of dollars) Equity CompanyObligations (1) Other Third-Party Obligations Total; Debt-related 1,092 138 1,230; Other 676 6,158 6,834; Total 1,768 6,296 8,064.\nTITLE: September 30, 2024\nTITLE: (millions of dollars)Equity CompanyObligations (1)Other Third-Party ObligationsTotal\nTITLE: Equity CompanyObligations (1)\nTITLE: Equity Company\nTITLE: Obligations (1)\nTITLE: Other Third-Party Obligations\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Guarantees\nTITLE: Total1,768 6,296 8,064\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 1,768\nTITLE: 6,296\nTITLE: 8,064\nTEXT: Additionally, the Corporation and its affiliates have numerous long-term sales and purchase commitments in their various business activities, all of which are expected to be fulfilled with no adverse consequences material to the Corporation’s operations or financial condition.\nTITLE: ExxonMobil Share of Accumulated OtherComprehensive Income(millions of dollars)\nTITLE: ExxonMobil Share of Accumulated Other\nTITLE: Comprehensive Income\nTITLE: Cumulative Foreign Exchange Translation Adjustment\nTITLE: PostretirementBenefits ReservesAdjustment\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: Balance as of December 31, 2022(14,591)1,321 (13,270)\nTITLE: Balance as of December 31, 2022\nTITLE: (14,591)\nTITLE: 1,321\nTITLE: (13,270)\nTEXT: Current period change excluding amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (1)\nTITLE: Balance as of September 30, 2023(14,465)1,377 (13,088)\nTITLE: Balance as of September 30, 2023\nTITLE: (14,465)\nTITLE: 1,377\nTITLE: (13,088)\nTITLE: Balance as of December 31, 2023(13,056)1,067 (11,989)\nTITLE: Balance as of December 31, 2023\nTITLE: (13,056)\nTITLE: 1,067\nTITLE: (11,989)\nTEXT: Current period change excluding amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (1)\nTITLE: Balance as of September 30, 2024(13,024)1,065 (11,959)\nTITLE: Balance as of September 30, 2024\nTITLE: (13,024)\nTITLE: 1,065\n"

Natural gas prices strengthened during the quarter and moved toward the top half of the 10-year range, supported by summer demand in North America and supply concerns in Europe. Industry refining margins declined versus the second quarter, and moved to the low end of the 10-year range, as record global demand was more than met by additional supply. Chemical margins improved slightly compared to the second quarter due to lower North America feed costs, though remained well below the 10-year range, as industry bottom-of-cycle conditions continued driven by oversupply in Asia.\nTITLE: Recent Mergers and Acquisitions\nTEXT: On May 3, 2024, ExxonMobil acquired Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer), an independent oil and gas exploration and production company.

Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. Lower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nTEXT: Base Volume.

The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several periods or several segments. Earnings (loss) excluding identified items does include non-operational earnings events or impacts that are generally below the $250 million threshold utilized for Identified Items. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management.

Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative Structural Cost Savings totaled $11.3 billion, which included an additional $1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both Structural Cost Savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Estimates of cumulative annual structural savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural Cost Savings are stewarded internally to support management's oversight of spending over time.

The decrease in earnings was mainly driven by weaker industry refining margins and higher Upstream depreciation, partially offset by favorable timing effects from derivatives mark-to-market impacts and increased volumes from advantaged Upstream investments in the Permian and Guyana.

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs), which typically occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\nTEXT: Entitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\nTEXT: Government Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels as a result of production limits or sanctions imposed by governments.\nTEXT: Divestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\nTEXT: Growth and Other comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.\nTITLE: ENERGY PRODUCTS\nTEXT: Energy Products Financial Results(millions of dollars)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,2024202320242023Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)United States517 1,356 1,803 4,794 Non-U.S.792 1,086 1,828 4,141 Total1,309 2,442 3,631 8,935 Identified Items (1)United States— — — — Non-U.S.— (33)— (45)Total— (33)— (45)Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)United States517 1,356 1,803 4,794 Non-U.S.792 1,119 1,828 4,186 Total1,309 2,475 3,631 8,980 Due to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\nTABLE: TABLE: (millions of dollars) Three Months EndedSeptember 30, Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,; 2024 2023 2024 2023; United States 517 1,356 1,803 4,794; Non-U.S. 792 1,086 1,828 4,141; Total 1,309 2,442 3,631 8,935; United States — — — —; Non-U.S. — (33) — (45); Total — (33) — (45); United States 517 1,356 1,803 4,794; Non-U.S. 792 1,119 1,828 4,186; Total 1,309 2,475 3,631 8,980.\nTITLE: Energy Products Financial Results\nTITLE: (millions of dollars)Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: Three Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,\nTITLE: 2024202320242023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) (U.S. GAAP)\nTITLE: Total1,309 2,442 3,631 8,935\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 1,309\nTITLE: 2,442\nTITLE: 3,631\nTITLE: 8,935\nTITLE: Identified Items (1)\nTITLE: Total— (33)— (45)\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: (33)\nTITLE: —\nTITLE: (45)\nTITLE: Earnings (loss) excluding Identified Items (1) (Non-GAAP)\nTITLE: Total1,309 2,475 3,631 8,980\nTITLE: Total\nTITLE: 1,309\nTITLE: 2,475\nTITLE: 3,631\nTITLE: 8,980\nTITLE: Energy Products Third Quarter Earnings Factor Analysis(millions of dollars)\nTABLE: TABLE: .\nTITLE: Energy Products Third Quarter Earnings Factor Analysis(millions of dollars)\nTITLE: Energy Products Third Quarter Earnings Factor Analysis\nTEXT: Margin – Margins decreased earnings by $2,400 million, driven by weaker industry refining margins.\nTEXT: Advantaged Volume Growth – Higher volumes from strategic projects increased earnings by $20 million.\nTEXT: Base Volume – Lower base volumes decreased earnings by $200 million, driven by divestments and the Joliet refinery weather event.\nTITLE: Structural Cost Savings – Increased earnings by $100 million.\n"

The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil’s business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect investment decisions made by ExxonMobil or its affiliates. Individual projects or opportunities may advance based on a number of factors, including availability of supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\nTEXT: The term “project” as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\nTEXT: (1) Heritage Permian basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.\nTEXT: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Quarter Ended September 30, 2024Total Numberof Shares Purchased (1)AveragePrice Paidper Share (2)Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program (Billions of dollars) (3)July 202416,452,996$115.1816,452,996$29.1August 202416,178,185$117.1416,178,004$27.2September 202415,110,603$114.0215,109,901$25.5Total47,741,784$115.4547,740,901(1) Includes shares withheld from participants in the company's incentive program for personal income taxes.(2) Excludes 1% U.S. excise tax on stock repurchases.(3) In its 2022 Corporate Plan Update released December 8, 2022, the Corporation stated that the company expanded its share repurchase program to up to $50 billion through 2024, including $15 billion of repurchases in 2022 and $17.5 billion in 2023.

A $1 per barrel change in the weighted-average realized price of oil would have approximately a $650 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per thousand cubic feet change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately a $155 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives.\nTEXT: Crude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical prices fluctuate in response to changing market forces. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.\n"
