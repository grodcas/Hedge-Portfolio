Net earnings were $17.1 billion, or $16.69 per diluted share. During fiscal 2022, we opened two new stores in the U.S. and four new stores in Mexico, and we lost one store in the U.S. due to a fire, resulting in a total store count of 2,322 at January 29, 2023. At the end of fiscal 2022, a total of 315 of our stores, or 13.6% of our total store count, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $627.17 in fiscal 2022. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.2 times at the end of fiscal 2022, compared to 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2022 resulting from strategic investments to promote higher in-stock levels and pull forward merchandise in response to ongoing global supply chain disruption, as well as continued investment in our new supply chain facilities and carryover of some spring seasonal inventory.\nTEXT: We generated $14.6 billion of cash flow from operations and issued $6.9 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, during fiscal 2022. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $7.8 billion for dividends and $6.7 billion for share repurchases. In addition, we repaid $2.5 billion of long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net short-term debt and funded $3.1 billion in capital expenditures during fiscal 2022. In February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.09 per share.\nTEXT: Our ROIC was 44.6% for fiscal 2022 and 44.7% for fiscal 2021. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).\nTITLE: RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTEXT: The following table presents the percentage relationship between net sales and major categories in our consolidated statements of earnings:\nTEXT: FiscalFiscalFiscal202220212020dollars in millions$% of Net Sales$% of Net Sales$% of Net SalesNet sales$157,403 $151,157 $132,110 Gross profit52,778 33.5 %50,832 33.6 %44,853 34.0 %Operating expenses:Selling, general and administrative26,284 16.7 25,406 16.8 24,447 18.5 Depreciation and amortization2,455 1.6 2,386 1.6 2,128 1.6 Total operating expenses28,739 18.3 27,792 18.4 26,575 20.1 Operating income24,039 15.3 23,040 15.2 18,278 13.8 Interest and other (income) expense:Interest income and other, net(55)— (44)— (47)— Interest expense1,617 1.0 1,347 0.9 1,347 1.0 Interest and other, net1,562 1.0 1,303 0.9 1,300 1.0 Earnings before provision for income taxes22,477 14.3 21,737 14.4 16,978 12.9 Provision for income taxes5,372 3.4 5,304 3.5 4,112 3.1 Net earnings$17,105 10.9 %$16,433 10.9 %$12,866 9.7 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal; 2022 2021 2020; dollars in millions $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales; Net sales $ 157,403 $ 151,157 $ 132,110; Gross profit 52,778 33.5 % 50,832 33.6 % 44,853 34.0 %; Selling, general and administrative 26,284 16.7 25,406 16.8 24,447 18.5; Depreciation and amortization 2,455 1.6 2,386 1.6 2,128 1.6; Total operating expenses 28,739 18.3 27,792 18.4 26,575 20.1; Operating income 24,039 15.3 23,040 15.2 18,278 13.8; Interest income and other, net (55) — (44) — (47) —; Interest expense 1,617 1.0 1,347 0.9 1,347 1.0; Interest and other, net 1,562 1.0 1,303 0.9 1,300 1.0; Earnings before provision for income taxes 22,477 14.3 21,737 14.4 16,978 12.9; Provision for income taxes 5,372 3.4 5,304 3.5 4,112 3.1; Net earnings $ 17,105 10.9 % $ 16,433 10.9 % $ 12,866 9.7 %.\nTITLE: FiscalFiscalFiscal\nTITLE: Fiscal\nTITLE: 202220212020\nTITLE: 2022\n"

Sales per retail square foot is a measure of the efficiency of sales based on the total square footage of our stores and is used by management to monitor the performance of the Company’s retail operations as an indicator of the productivity of owned and leased square footage for these retail operations.\nTITLE: FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\nTITLE: Sales\nTEXT: We assess our sales performance by evaluating both net sales and comparable sales.\nTEXT: Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal 2022 increased $6.2 billion, or 4.1%, to $157.4 billion. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2022 primarily reflected the impact of positive comparable sales driven by an increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a decrease in comparable customer transactions. A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $339 million in fiscal 2022.\nTEXT: Online sales, which consist of sales generated online through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.2% of net sales and grew by 7.4% during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in online sales in fiscal 2022 was a result of customers continuing to leverage our digital platforms and reflects our ongoing investments to enhance these platforms and related fulfillment capabilities, which support our interconnected retail strategy.\nTEXT: Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTEXT: Total comparable sales increased 3.1% in fiscal 2022, reflecting an 8.8% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 5.4% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable average ticket was primarily driven by inflation, as well as demand for new and innovative products. The decrease in comparable customer transactions reflects the impact of macroeconomic factors during fiscal 2022, including indications of price sensitivity to the broader inflationary environment and a gradual shift in consumer spending from goods back to services, resulting in transactions trending towards fiscal 2019, pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\nTEXT: For fiscal 2022, 10 of our 14 merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales, led by Building Materials, Plumbing, Millwork, Paint, Hardware, and Kitchen and Bath, which posted comparable sales above the Company average. Our Indoor Garden, Outdoor Garden, Appliances, and Flooring departments posted negative comparable sales.\n"

Gross profit as a percent of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.5% in fiscal 2022 compared to 33.6% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was primarily driven by higher product and transportation costs, pressure from shrink during the second half of the year, and investments in our supply chain network, offset by the benefit from higher retail prices, along with favorable product mix.\nTITLE: Operating Expenses\nTEXT: Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nTEXT: Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A increased $878 million, or 3.5%, to $26.3 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 16.7% in fiscal 2022 compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by wage investments for hourly associates and increased operational costs, including planned investments designed to drive efficiencies in our stores.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased $69 million, or 2.9%, to $2.5 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 1.6% in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, reflecting leverage from a positive comparable sales environment, offset by increased depreciation expense from strategic investments in the business.\nTITLE: Interest and Other, net\nTEXT: Interest and other, net increased $259 million, or 19.9%, to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2022. As a percent of net sales, interest and other, net, was 1.0% in fiscal 2022 compared to 0.9% in fiscal 2021, primarily reflecting higher interest expense due to higher debt balances and increased variable rate interest on floating rate debt resulting from interest rate swaps, partially offset by leverage from a positive comparable sales environment.\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: Our combined effective income tax rate was 23.9% in fiscal 2022 compared to 24.4% in fiscal 2021. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2022 was driven by certain discrete tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2022.\nTITLE: Diluted Earnings per Share\nTEXT: Diluted earnings per share were $16.69 in fiscal 2022 compared to $15.53 in fiscal 2021. The increase in diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by higher net earnings during fiscal 2022, as well as lower diluted shares due to share repurchases.\nTITLE: NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTEXT: To provide clarity on our operating performance, we supplement our reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures. However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nTITLE: Return on Invested Capital\nTEXT: We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\nTEXT: The following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):\nTEXT: FiscalFiscalFiscaldollars in millions202220212020Net earnings$17,105 $16,433 $12,866 Interest and other, net1,562 1,303 1,300 Provision for income taxes5,372 5,304 4,112 Operating income24,039 23,040 18,278 Income tax adjustment (1)(5,745)(5,622)(4,423)NOPAT$18,294 $17,418 $13,855 Average debt and equity$41,055 $38,946 $33,964 ROIC44.6 %44.7 %40.8 %\nTABLE: TABLE: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal; dollars in millions 2022 2021 2020; Net earnings $ 17,105 $ 16,433 $ 12,866; Interest and other, net 1,562 1,303 1,300; Provision for income taxes 5,372 5,304 4,112; Operating income 24,039 23,040 18,278; Income tax adjustment (1) (5,745) (5,622) (4,423); NOPAT $ 18,294 $ 17,418 $ 13,855; Average debt and equity $ 41,055 $ 38,946 $ 33,964; ROIC 44.6 % 44.7 % 40.8 %.\nTITLE: FiscalFiscalFiscal\nTITLE: Fiscal\nTITLE: dollars in millions202220212020\nTITLE: dollars in millions\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\nTITLE: 2020\nTEXT: (1)Income tax adjustment is defined as operating income multiplied by our effective tax rate for the trailing twelve months.\n"

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. For fiscal 2023, we plan to invest approximately $3 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate. Capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in fiscal 2022.\nTEXT: During fiscal 2022, we paid cash dividends of $7.8 billion to shareholders. In February 2023, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $1.90 to $2.09 per share. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: In August 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $20.0 billion, which was approved in May 2021. This new authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of January 29, 2023, approximately $12.5 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During fiscal 2022, we had cash payments of $6.7 billion for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases.\nTITLE: DEBT\nTEXT: In July 2022, we expanded our commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion to further enhance our financial flexibility. All of our short-term borrowings in fiscal 2022 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $2.7 billion. In connection with our program, we have back-up credit facilities with a consortium of banks. In July 2022, we also expanded the borrowing capacity under these back-up facilities from $3.0 billion to $5.0 billion by entering into a five-year $3.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2027 and a 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility scheduled to expire in July 2023. These facilities replaced our previously existing five-year $2.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023, and our 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility, which was scheduled to expire in December 2022. At January 29, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nTEXT: We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. In March 2022, we issued $4.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of shares of our common stock. In September 2022, we issued an additional $3.0 billion of senior notes. The net proceeds from this issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of senior notes. At January 29, 2023, we had an aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding of $41.2 billion, with $1.0 billion payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these senior notes total $24.9 billion, with $1.7 billion payable within 12 months, based on current interest rates, which include the impact of our active interest rate swap agreements.\nTEXT: The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing the notes contain various customary covenants; however, none are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nTITLE: LEASES\nTEXT: We use operating and finance leases largely to fund a portion of our real estate, including our stores, distribution centers, and store support centers. At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate lease obligations of $14.7 billion, with $1.5 billion payable within 12 months. Aggregate lease obligations include $2.1 billion of obligations related to leases not yet commenced. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our operating and finance leases.\n"

We issue inventory purchase orders in the ordinary course of business, which are typically cancellable by their terms, therefore we do not consider purchase orders that are cancellable to be firm inventory commitments. At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate purchase obligations of $1.8 billion, with $947 million payable within 12 months.\nTEXT: At January 29, 2023, we had aggregate liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits totaling $643 million, none of which are expected to be paid in the next 12 months. The timing of payment, if any, associated with our long-term unrecognized tax benefit liabilities is unknown. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our unrecognized tax benefits.\nTEXT: We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nTITLE: CASH FLOWS SUMMARY\nTITLE: Operating Activities\nTEXT: Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.0 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily driven by changes in working capital, slightly offset by an increase in net earnings. Changes in working capital were driven by inventory management actions and the related timing of vendor payments. These inventory management actions, which began in fiscal 2021 and moderated during the second half of fiscal 2022, reflect strategic investments in inventory to support the demand environment, promote higher in-stock levels, and pull forward merchandise for seasonal events in response to global supply chain disruption, as well as investments in our new supply chain facilities.\nTITLE: Investing Activities\nTEXT: Cash used in investing activities increased by $171 million in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily resulting from increased capital expenditures, partially offset by cash paid for an acquired business during fiscal 2021.\nTITLE: Financing Activities\nTEXT: Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2022 primarily reflected $7.8 billion of cash dividends paid, $6.7 billion of share repurchases, $2.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, and $1.0 billion of net repayments of short-term debt, partially offset by $6.9 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt.\nTEXT: Cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 primarily reflected $14.8 billion of share repurchases, $7.0 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.5 billion of repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by $3.0 billion of net proceeds from long-term debt and $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt. Fiscal 2021 reflected elevated share repurchase activity following the temporary suspension of repurchases during fiscal 2020 in order to enhance our liquidity position at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nTEXT: The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nTEXT: Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumptions or complex estimates.\n"

Under the retail inventory method, inventories are stated at cost, which is determined by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventories.\nTEXT: The retail value of our inventory is adjusted as needed to reflect current market conditions. Because these adjustments are based on current prevailing market conditions, the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market. The valuation under the retail inventory method is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As such, there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit. We determine markups and markdowns based on the consideration of a variety of factors such as current and anticipated demand, customer preferences and buying trends, age of the merchandise, and weather conditions.\nTEXT: We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. A 10% increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have increased cost of sales by approximately $113 million for fiscal 2022. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\nTEXT: We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood for a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method. We believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and results in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market.\nTITLE: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTEXT: For information on our accounting policies and on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended January 29, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nTEXT: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated March 15, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nTITLE: Basis for Opinion\nTEXT: These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nTEXT: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n"

The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nTEXT: As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company’s U.S. merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first out) or market as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. The Company calculates shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results.\nTEXT: We identified the evaluation of the estimation of store shrink occurring in the period between physical inventory counts and fiscal year-end as a critical audit matter. Evaluating the Company’s estimation of shrink at the end of the fiscal year using interim inventory loss experience in U.S. retail stores involved auditor judgment.\nTEXT: The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the process of developing the estimate of store shrink. We evaluated the appropriateness of the Company using interim physical inventory counts to estimate inventory losses in U.S. retail stores at the end of the fiscal year by:\nTEXT: •Evaluating the method and certain assumptions used;\nTEXT: •Testing the application of the method and certain assumptions used;\nTEXT: •Performing a current year trend analysis; and\nTEXT: •Performing a sensitivity analysis over the shrink reserve estimate.\nTEXT: We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1979.\nTITLE: THE HOME DEPOT, INC.\nTITLE: CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nTEXT: in millions, except per share dataJanuary 29,2023January 30,2022AssetsCurrent assets:Cash and cash equivalents$2,757 $2,343 Receivables, net3,317 3,426 Merchandise inventories24,886 22,068 Other current assets1,511 1,218 Total current assets32,471 29,055 Net property and equipment25,631 25,199 Operating lease right-of-use assets6,941 5,968 Goodwill7,444 7,449 Other assets3,958 4,205 Total assets$76,445 $71,876 Liabilities and Stockholders’ EquityCurrent liabilities:Short-term debt$— $1,035 Accounts payable11,443 13,462 Accrued salaries and related expenses1,991 2,426 Sales taxes payable528 848 Deferred revenue3,064 3,596 Income taxes payable50 158 Current installments of long-term debt1,231 2,447 Current operating lease liabilities945 830 Other accrued expenses3,858 3,891 Total current liabilities23,110 28,693 Long-term debt, excluding current installments41,962 36,604 Long-term operating lease liabilities6,226 5,353 Deferred income taxes1,019 909 Other long-term liabilities2,566 2,013 Total liabilities74,883 73,572 Commitments and contingencies (Note 11)Common stock, par value $0.05; authorized: 10,000 shares; issued: 1,794 shares at January 29, 2023 and 1,792 shares at January 30, 2022; outstanding: 1,016 shares at January 29, 2023 and 1,035 shares at January 30, 202290 90 Paid-in capital12,592 12,132 Retained earnings76,896 67,580 Accumulated other comprehensive loss(718)(704)Treasury stock, at cost, 778 shares at January 29, 2023 and 757 shares at January 30, 2022(87,298)(80,794)Total stockholders’ equity (deficit)1,562 (1,696)Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity$76,445 $71,876\nTABLE: TABLE: in millions, except per share data January 29,2023 January 30,2022; Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,757 $ 2,343; Receivables, net 3,317 3,426; Merchandise inventories 24,886 22,068; Other current assets 1,511 1,218; Total current assets 32,471 29,055; Net property and equipment 25,631 25,199; Operating lease right-of-use assets 6,941 5,968; Goodwill 7,444 7,449; Other assets 3,958 4,205; Total assets $ 76,445 $ 71,876; Short-term debt $ — $ 1,035; Accounts payable 11,443 13,462; Accrued salaries and related expenses 1,991 2,426; Sales taxes payable 528 848; Deferred revenue 3,064 3,596; Income taxes payable 50 158; Current installments of long-term debt 1,231 2,447; Current operating lease liabilities 945 830; Other accrued expenses 3,858 3,891; Total current liabilities 23,110 28,693; Long-term debt, excluding current installments 41,962 36,604; Long-term operating lease liabilities 6,226 5,353; Deferred income taxes 1,019 909; Other long-term liabilities 2,566 2,013; Total liabilities 74,883 73,572; Common stock, par value $0.05; authorized: 10,000 shares; issued: 1,794 shares at January 29, 2023 and 1,792 shares at January 30, 2022; outstanding: 1,016 shares at January 29, 2023 and 1,035 shares at January 30, 2022 90 90; Paid-in capital 12,592 12,132; Retained earnings 76,896 67,580; Accumulated other comprehensive loss (718) (704); Treasury stock, at cost, 778 shares at January 29, 2023 and 757 shares at January 30, 2022 (87,298) (80,794); Total stockholders’ equity (deficit) 1,562 (1,696); Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $ 76,445 $ 71,876.\n"

We also provide a number of services, including home improvement installation services and tool and equipment rental. We operate in the U.S. (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the territories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam), Canada, and Mexico.\nTITLE: Consolidation and Presentation\nTEXT: Our consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week period ending on the Sunday nearest to January 31st. All periods presented include 52 weeks.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: We have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses in preparing these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. While we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nTITLE: Cash and Cash Equivalents\nTEXT: Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less.\n"

Rebate receivables represent amounts due from vendors for volume and co-op advertising rebates. Customer receivables relate to credit extended directly to certain customers in the ordinary course of business. The valuation allowance related to these receivables was not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nTITLE: Merchandise Inventories\nTEXT: Inventory cost includes the amount we pay to acquire inventory, including freight and import costs, as well as operating costs and depreciation associated with our sourcing and distribution network, and is net of certain vendor allowances. The majority of our merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market, as determined by the retail inventory method, which is based on a number of factors such as markups, markdowns, and inventory losses (or shrink). As the inventory retail value is adjusted regularly to reflect market conditions, inventory valued using the retail method approximates the lower of cost or market. Certain subsidiaries, including retail operations in Canada and Mexico, and distribution centers, record merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value, as determined by a cost method. These merchandise inventories represent approximately 42% of the total merchandise inventories balance. We evaluate the inventory valued using a cost method at the end of each quarter to ensure that it is carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and the adjustments recorded to merchandise inventories valued under a cost method were not material to our consolidated financial statements at the end of fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nTEXT: Physical inventory counts or cycle counts are taken on a regular basis in each store and distribution center to ensure that amounts reflected in merchandise inventories are properly stated. Shrink (or in the case of excess inventory, swell) is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory count. We calculate shrink based on actual inventory losses identified as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses between physical inventory counts. The estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory counts is calculated on a store-specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink results. Historically, the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory losses has not been material to our annual financial results.\nTITLE: Property and Equipment\nTEXT: Buildings and related improvements, furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements and assets held under finance leases are amortized using the straight-line method over the original term of the lease or the useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter.\nTEXT: The following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment:\nTITLE: LifeBuildings and improvements5 – 45 yearsFurniture, fixtures and equipment2 – 20 yearsLeasehold improvements5 – 45 years\nTABLE: TABLE: Buildings and improvements 5 – 45 years; Furniture, fixtures and equipment 2 – 20 years; Leasehold improvements 5 – 45 years.\nTITLE: LifeBuildings and improvements5 – 45 yearsFurniture, fixtures and equipment2 – 20 yearsLeasehold improvements5 – 45 years\nTITLE: Life\nTEXT: We capitalize certain costs, including interest, related to construction in progress and the acquisition and development of software. Costs associated with the acquisition and development of software are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which ranges from three to seven years. Certain development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalization are expensed as incurred.\nTEXT: We evaluate our long-lived assets each quarter for indicators of potential impairment. Indicators of impairment include current period losses combined with a history of losses, our decision to relocate or close a store or other location before the end of its previously estimated useful life, or when changes in other circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation for long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is generally the individual store level. The assets of a store with indicators of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flows with their carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flows, we then measure the asset group’s fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized. If the resulting fair value is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. Impairment losses on property and equipment are recorded as a component of SG&A. Impairment charges for long-lived assets were not material to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, or fiscal 2020.\n"

Specifically, a contract is or contains a lease when (1) the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and (2) we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\nTEXT: Our leases include certain retail locations, warehouse and distribution space, office space, equipment, and vehicles. A substantial majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of one to 20 years. Our real estate leases typically provide the option to extend the lease for five-year terms, and some of our leases may include the option to terminate in less than five years. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including market conditions, real estate strategies, the nature, length, and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Based on these determinations, we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal options would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement.\nTEXT: The discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use a secured incremental borrowing rate, which is updated on a quarterly basis, as the discount rate for the present value of lease payments.\nTEXT: Real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and operating expenses applicable to the leased asset are generally our obligations under our lease agreements. In instances where these payments are fixed, they are included in the measurement of our lease liabilities, and when variable, are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Certain of our lease agreements also include rental payments based on an index or rate and others include rental payments based on a percentage of sales. For variable payments dependent upon an index or rate, we apply the active index or rate as of the lease commencement date. Variable lease payments not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liabilities as they cannot be reasonably estimated, and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nTEXT: Leases that have a term of twelve months or less upon commencement are considered short-term in nature. Short-term leases are not included on the consolidated balance sheets and are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for certain classes of assets including real estate and certain equipment.\nTEXT: Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nTITLE: Business Combinations\nTEXT: The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\n"

We do not amortize goodwill, but assess the recoverability of goodwill in the third quarter of each fiscal year, or more often if indicators warrant, by determining whether the fair value of each reporting unit supports its carrying value. Each fiscal year, we may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments, with a quantitative assessment completed as facts and circumstances warrant. We completed our last quantitative assessment in fiscal 2019 and concluded that the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, including goodwill.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our U.S., Canada, and Mexico reporting units based on qualitative factors. We performed a qualitative assessment to determine if there were any indicators of impairment and concluded that while there have been events and circumstances in the macro-environment that have impacted us, we have not experienced any entity-specific indicators that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units were less than their carrying amounts.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested in the third quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more often if indicators warrant. During the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we completed our annual assessment of the recoverability of our indefinite-lived intangible assets based on quantitative factors and concluded no impairment losses should be recognized.

We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only; we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All derivative instruments are recognized at their fair values in either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and are classified as either current or non-current based on each contract’s respective maturity. While we enter into master netting arrangements, our policy is to present the fair value of derivative instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated balance sheets.\nTEXT: Changes in the fair values for derivative instruments designated as cash flow or net investment hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings, which for net investment hedges is upon sale or substantial liquidation of the underlying net investment.

We recognize the expected ultimate cost for claims incurred (undiscounted) at the balance sheet date as a liability. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates.

Our liability for sales returns is estimated based on historical return levels and our expectation of future returns. We also recognize a return asset, and corresponding adjustment to cost of sales, for our right to recover the goods returned by the customer, measured at the former carrying amount of the goods, less any expected recovery cost. At each financial reporting date, we assess our estimates of expected returns, refund liabilities, and return assets. Adjustments related to changes in return estimates were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.\nTEXT: Services revenue is generated through a variety of installation, home maintenance, and professional service programs. In these programs, the customer selects and purchases material for a project, and we provide or arrange for professional installation. These programs are offered through our stores, online, and in-home sales programs. Under certain programs, when we provide or arrange for the installation of a project and the subcontractor provides material as part of the installation, both the material and labor are included in services revenue. We recognize services revenue when the service for the customer is complete, which is not materially different from recognizing the revenue over the service period as the substantial majority of our services are completed within one week.\nTEXT: For products and services sold in stores or online, payment is typically due at the point of sale. When we receive payment from customers before the customer has taken possession of the merchandise or the service has been performed, the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the sale or service is complete. Such performance obligations are part of contracts with expected original durations of typically three months or less. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, deferred revenue for products and services was $2.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively.\nTEXT: We further record deferred revenue for the sale of gift cards and recognize the associated revenue upon the redemption of those gift cards, which generally occurs within six months of gift card issuance. As of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.\nTEXT: We also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales.\nTITLE: Cost of Sales\nTEXT: Cost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\nTITLE: Vendor Allowances\nTEXT: Vendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors’ products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.\nTITLE: Selling, General and Administrative\nTEXT: Selling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs.\nTITLE: Advertising Expense\nTEXT: Advertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears.

We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair values. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stock-based compensation expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 8.\nTITLE: Income Taxes\nTEXT: Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes versus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\nTEXT: We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nTEXT: We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return which includes certain eligible subsidiaries. Non-U.S. subsidiaries and certain U.S. subsidiaries, which are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, are not eligible to be included in our consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Separate provisions for income taxes have been determined for these entities. For unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, we are required to make an assertion regarding reinvestment or repatriation for tax purposes. For any earnings that we do not make a permanent reinvestment assertion, we recognize a provision for deferred income taxes. For earnings where we have made a permanent reinvestment assertion, no provision is recognized. See Note 5 for further discussion.\nTEXT: We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and SG&A, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\nTEXT: We are subject to global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) tax, an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made an accounting election to record this tax in the period the tax arises.\nTITLE: Comprehensive Income\nTEXT: Comprehensive income includes net earnings adjusted for certain gains and losses that are excluded from net earnings and recognized within accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of equity, which consist primarily of foreign currency translation adjustments. Accumulated other comprehensive loss also includes net losses on cash flow hedges that were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. Reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings were immaterial in fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.\nTITLE: Foreign Currency Translation\nTEXT: Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates for the period and equity transactions are translated using the actual rate on the day of the transaction. Cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022 were losses of $597 million and $575 million, respectively.\nTITLE: Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nTEXT: ASU No. 2021-10. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, “Government Assistance (Topic 832),” to improve the transparency of government assistance received by business entities that are accounted for by applying either the International Accounting Standards 20 grant model or Accounting Standards Codification 958-605 contribution model by analogy. Topic 832 requires disclosure of the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used, the line items on the balance sheet and income statement that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item, and significant terms of the transactions. On January 31, 2022, we adopted ASU No. 2021-10 with no impact to our financial statements or related disclosures as the transactions in scope of this guidance were immaterial.\n"

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, “Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations,” to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs used by an entity in connection with the purchase of goods and services. The standard requires entities that use supplier finance programs to disclose the key terms, including a description of payment terms, the confirmed amount outstanding under the program at the end of each reporting period, a description of where those obligations are presented on the balance sheet, and an annual rollforward, including the amount of obligations confirmed and the amount paid during the period. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. ASU No. 2022-04 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the requirement on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.\nTEXT: ASU No. 2020-04. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,” which provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12,\nTEXT: 2020 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. This guidance was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2022-06, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848,” which was effective upon issuance in December 2022 and extended the temporary relief provided by Topic 848 through December 31, 2024. While the discontinuance of LIBOR will impact our interest rate swap agreements, we do not anticipate the transition to a new reference rate and adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTEXT: Recent accounting pronouncements adopted or pending adoption not discussed above are either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTITLE: 2.SEGMENT REPORTING AND NET SALES\nTEXT: We currently conduct our retail operations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, each of which represents one of our three operating segments. Our operating segments reflect the way in which internally-reported financial information is regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker to analyze performance, make decisions and allocate resources. For disclosure purposes, we aggregate these three operating segments into one reportable segment due to the similar nature of their operations and economic characteristics.\nTEXT: The following table presents net property and equipment, classified by geography:\nTEXT: in millionsJanuary 29,2023January 30,2022January 31,2021Net property and equipment – in the U.S.$23,057 $22,696 $22,205 Net property and equipment – outside the U.S.2,574 2,503 2,500 Net property and equipment$25,631 $25,199 $24,705\nTABLE: TABLE: in millions January 29,2023 January 30,2022 January 31,2021; Net property and equipment – in the U.S. $ 23,057 $ 22,696 $ 22,205; Net property and equipment – outside the U.S. 2,574 2,503 2,500; Net property and equipment $ 25,631 $ 25,199 $ 24,705.\nTITLE: in millionsJanuary 29,2023January 30,2022January 31,2021\nTITLE: in millions\nTITLE: January 29,2023\nTITLE: January 30,2022\nTITLE: January 31,2021\nTEXT: No sales to an individual customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue during any of the last three fiscal years.\nTEXT: The following table presents net sales, classified by geography:\nTEXT: FiscalFiscalFiscalin millions202220212020Net sales – in the U.S.$144,840 $138,920 $122,158 Net sales – outside the U.S.12,563 12,237 9,952 Net sales$157,403 $151,157 $132,110\nTABLE: TABLE: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal; in millions 2022 2021 2020; Net sales – in the U.S. $ 144,840 $ 138,920 $ 122,158; Net sales – outside the U.S. 12,563 12,237 9,952; Net sales $ 157,403 $ 151,157 $ 132,110.\nTITLE: FiscalFiscalFiscal\nTITLE: Fiscal\nTITLE: in millions202220212020\nTITLE: in millions\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\nTITLE: 2020\nTEXT: The following table presents net sales by products and services:\nTEXT: FiscalFiscalFiscalin millions202220212020Net sales – products $151,804 $145,745 $127,671 Net sales – services 5,599 5,412 4,439 Net sales$157,403 $151,157 $132,110\nTABLE: TABLE: Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal; in millions 2022 2021 2020; Net sales – products $ 151,804 $ 145,745 $ 127,671; Net sales – services 5,599 5,412 4,439; Net sales $ 157,403 $ 151,157 $ 132,110.\nTITLE: FiscalFiscalFiscal\nTITLE: Fiscal\nTITLE: in millions202220212020\nTITLE: in millions\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\n"

All of our senior notes may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, at the redemption price plus accrued interest up to the redemption date. With respect to the 5.875% 2036 notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the notes to be redeemed that would be due after the related redemption date. With respect to all other notes, prior to the Par Call Date, as defined in the respective notes, the redemption price is equal to the greater of (1) 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (2) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to the Par Call Date. On or after the Par Call Date, the redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes.

Our objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and minimize the risk of changes in the fair value of our senior notes.\nTEXT: Fair Value Hedges. We had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with combined notional amounts of $5.4 billion at January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022. These agreements were accounted for as fair value hedges that swap fixed for variable rate interest to hedge changes in the fair values of certain senior notes. At January 29, 2023, the fair values of these agreements totaled $778 million, all of which is recognized in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. At January 30, 2022, the fair values of these agreements totaled $191 million, with $58 million recognized in other assets and $249 million recognized in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. All of our interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges meet the shortcut method requirements under GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair values of these agreements offset the changes in the fair value of the hedged long-term debt.\nTEXT: Cash Flow Hedges. At January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges, which hedge the variability of forecasted cash flows associated with certain payments made in our foreign operations. At January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, the notional amounts and the fair values of these contracts were not material. Additionally, the realized and unrealized gains and losses on these instruments were not material during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.\nTEXT: We also settled forward-starting interest rate swap agreements in prior years, which were used to hedge the variability in future interest payments attributable to changing interest rates on forecasted debt issuances. Unamortized losses on these forward-starting swaps, which were designated as cash flow hedges, are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective notes. Unamortized losses recognized on these swaps remaining in accumulated other comprehensive loss were immaterial as of January 29, 2023 and January 30, 2022, as were the losses recognized within interest expense for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.\nTEXT: We expect an immaterial amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of January 29, 2023 to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.\nTEXT: Net Investment Hedges. During fiscal 2022, we issued foreign currency forward contracts accounted for as net investment hedges, which hedged against foreign currency exposure on our net investment in certain subsidiaries. These foreign currency forward contracts were immaterial and were settled in fiscal 2022. The related foreign currency translation adjustment amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon settlement were also immaterial. There were no arrangements accounted for as net investment hedges outstanding as of January 29, 2023 or January 30, 2022.\nTEXT: Collateral. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $634 million as of January 29, 2023, which was recorded in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We did not hold any cash collateral as of January 29, 2023, and cash collateral both held and posted was immaterial as of January 30, 2022.\nTITLE: 5.INCOME TAXES\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: The following table presents our earnings before the provision for income taxes:\nTITLE: in millionsFiscalFiscalFiscal202220212020United States$20,990 $20,320 $16,013 Foreign1,487 1,417 965 Total$22,477 $21,737 $16,978\nTABLE: TABLE: in millions Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal; 2022 2021 2020; United States $ 20,990 $ 20,320 $ 16,013; Foreign 1,487 1,417 965; Total $ 22,477 $ 21,737 $ 16,978.\nTITLE: in millionsFiscalFiscalFiscal202220212020United States$20,990 $20,320 $16,013 Foreign1,487 1,417 965 Total$22,477 $21,737 $16,978\nTITLE: in millionsFiscalFiscalFiscal\nTITLE: in millions\nTITLE: Fiscal\nTITLE: 202220212020\nTITLE: 2022\nTITLE: 2021\n"

Therefore, the tax effects of repatriation for applicable state taxes and foreign withholding taxes of such cash earnings have been provided for in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. We have the intent and ability to reinvest substantially all of the $4.1 billion of non-cash unremitted earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries indefinitely. Accordingly, no provision for state taxes or foreign withholding taxes was recorded on these unremitted earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. It is impracticable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these indefinitely reinvested earnings due to the complexities associated with the hypothetical calculation.\nTITLE: Tax Return Examination Status\nTEXT: Our income tax returns are routinely examined by U.S. federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. As of January 29, 2023, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2010. Our U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2021, with the exception of 2015, are currently under examination by the IRS. With respect to the fiscal years 2010 to 2014, the IRS has issued a proposed adjustment relating to transfer pricing between our entities in the U.S. and China. We are defending our position using all available remedies. There are also ongoing U.S. state and local audits and other foreign audits covering fiscal years 2013 through 2020. We do not expect the results from any ongoing income tax audit to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nTEXT: Over the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the resolution of federal and state tax examinations, as well as the expiration of statutes of limitations, could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount.

A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.

Restrictions on the restricted stock issued under the Plans generally lapse over various periods up to five years. At the grant date of the award, recipients of restricted stock are granted voting rights and generally receive dividends on unvested shares, paid in the form of cash on each dividend payment date. Dividends paid on unvested shares were immaterial for fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020.

Additionally, the awards become non-forfeitable upon the associate’s attainment of age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service and minimum performance targets are achieved. Recipients of performance share awards have no voting rights until the shares are issued following completion of the performance period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the performance shares (as reinvested shares) and are paid upon the payout of the award based upon the actual number of shares earned. The fair value of the restricted stock and performance shares is based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and is expensed over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\nTEXT: Restricted Stock Units. Each restricted stock unit entitles the associate to one share of common stock to be received upon vesting up to five years after the grant date. Additionally, the majority of these awards may become non-forfeitable upon the associate reaching age 60, provided the associate has had five years of continuous service.

The plan for U.S. associates is a tax-qualified plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. The non-U.S. plan is not a Section 423 plan. At January 29, 2023, there were approximately 16 million shares available under the U.S. plan and approximately 18 million shares available under the non-U.S. plan. The purchase price of shares under the ESPPs is equal to 85% of the stock’s fair market value on the last day of the purchase period, which is a six-month period ending on December 31 and June 30 of each year. During fiscal 2022, there were approximately 1 million shares purchased under the ESPPs at an average price of $247.86. Under the outstanding ESPPs at January 29, 2023, associates have contributed $22 million to purchase shares at 85% of the stock’s fair market value on the last day of the current purchase period, June 30, 2023.\nTITLE: 9.EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nTEXT: We maintain active defined contribution retirement plans for our associates (the “Benefit Plans”). All associates satisfying certain service requirements are eligible to participate in the Benefit Plans. We make cash contributions each payroll period up to specified percentages of associates’ contributions as approved by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: We also maintain the Restoration Plans to provide certain associates deferred compensation that they would have received under the Benefit Plans as a matching contribution if not for the maximum compensation limits under the Internal Revenue Code.

HD SUPPLY ACQUISITION\nTEXT: On November 16, 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire HD Supply, a leading national distributor of MRO products to multifamily, hospitality, healthcare, and government housing facilities, among others. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Home Depot made a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of the common stock of HD Supply Holdings, Inc., the ultimate parent entity of HD Supply, for $56 per share, and the acquisition was completed on December 24, 2020. The acquisition was funded through cash on hand, a portion of which was replaced with the proceeds from our issuance of $3.0 billion of senior notes in January 2021.\nTEXT: The following table summarizes total purchase consideration:\nTEXT: in millions Total cash consideration for outstanding shares$8,637 Value of stock-based awards attributed to services already rendered (1)55 Total purchase consideration$8,692\nTABLE: TABLE: Total cash consideration for outstanding shares $ 8,637; Value of stock-based awards attributed to services already rendered (1) 55; Total purchase consideration $ 8,692.\n"
