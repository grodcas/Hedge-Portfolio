In addition, we believe that certain ratios that utilize tangible common equity, such as return on average tangible common equity (“ROTCE”) and tangible book value per common share, also non-GAAP financial measures, are useful for evaluating the operating performance and capital adequacy of the business period-to-period, respectively.

See “Fee-Based Client Assets Rollforwards” herein.Transactional RevenuesTransactional revenues of $1,264 million in the current quarter and $2,137 million in the current year period increased 62% and 18%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily driven by higher client activity, particularly in equity-related transactions, and gains on DCP investments. For further information on the impact of DCP, see “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.Net InterestNet interest revenues of $1,910 million in the current quarter increased 6% compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to the cumulative impact of lending growth and changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the net effect of lower interest rates.Net interest revenues of $3,812 million in the current year period increased 4% compared with the prior year period, primarily due to the cumulative impact of lending growth and changes in balance sheet mix, partially offset by the net effect of lower interest rates and lower average sweep deposits.The level and pace of interest rate changes and other macroeconomic factors have impacted client preferences, including cash allocation to higher-yielding products and client demand for loans. These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions and changes in the path of interest rates, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.Provision for Credit LossesThe Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $28 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending portfolio and portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $22 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to certain specific securities-based loans.The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $72 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending portfolio and residential real estate loans related to California wildfires. In the prior year, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $14 million was primarily related to certain specific securities-based and commercial real estate loans, mainly in the office sector. This was partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. Non-Interest ExpensesNon-interest expenses of $5,536 million in the current quarter and $10,868 million in the current year period increased 12% and 8%, respectively, compared with the prior year periods, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.•Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by higher compensable revenues and higher expenses related to DCP.\n"

These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions and changes in the path of interest rates, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.Provision for Credit LossesThe Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $28 million in the current quarter was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending portfolio and portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $22 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to certain specific securities-based loans.The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $72 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending portfolio and residential real estate loans related to California wildfires. In the prior year, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $14 million was primarily related to certain specific securities-based and commercial real estate loans, mainly in the office sector.

While higher market levels drove increases in average AUM in the current quarter, there were continued net outflows in the Equity asset class, offset by higher net inflows in the Alternatives and Solutions and Fixed Income asset classes reflecting client preferences. Although the net outflows in Equity asset class have started to slow in the current year period, outflows may nonetheless be influenced by the structure and performance of our investment strategies and products relative to their benchmarks. To the extent these conditions continue, we would expect our Asset management revenue to continue to be impacted.See “Assets Under Management or Supervision” herein.Performance-based Income and OtherPerformance-based income and other revenues of $118 million in the current quarter increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure funds and gains on DCP investments compared with losses in the prior year quarter, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds.Performance-based income and other revenues of $269 million in the current year period increased from the prior year period, primarily due to higher accrued carried interest in infrastructure and real estate funds, partially offset by lower accrued carried interest in certain private funds.Non-Interest ExpensesNon-interest expenses of $1,229 million in the current quarter increased 6% from the prior year quarter, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. •Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher expenses related to DCP and higher compensation associated with carried interest. •Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM, partially offset by lower occupancy expenses.Non-interest expenses of $2,508 million in the current year period increased 9% from the prior year period, as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses and Non-compensation expenses. •Compensation and benefits expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher compensation associated with carried interest. •Non-compensation expenses increased in the current year period, primarily due to higher distribution expenses on higher AUM.\n"

Regulatory Liquidity FrameworkLiquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding RatioWe and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable funding, which is their projected minimum funding needs, over a one-year time horizon. As of June 30, 2025, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.Liquidity Coverage RatioAverage Daily BalanceThree Months Ended$ in millionsJune 30,2025March 31,2025Eligible HQLACash deposits with central banks$52,122 $53,674 Securities1241,114 221,883 Total Eligible HQLA$293,236 $275,557 Net cash outflows$218,347 $212,276 LCR134 %130 %1.Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.Net Stable Funding RatioAverage Daily BalanceThree Months Ended$ in millionsJune 30,2025March 31,2025Available stable funding$664,050 $629,739 Required stable funding542,395 523,720 NSFR122 %120 %Funding ManagementWe manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded.

The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable funding, which is their projected minimum funding needs, over a one-year time horizon. As of June 30, 2025, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.\n"

In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities.For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements.Credit RatingsWe rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors.\n"

Our capital buffer requirement computed under the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market RWAs (“Standardized Approach”) is equal to the sum of our SCB, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB, and our capital buffer requirement computed under the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (“Advanced Approach”) is equal to our 2.5% capital conservation buffer, G-SIB capital surcharge and CCyB.Regulatory MinimumAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024StandardizedAdvancedRequired ratios1CET1 capital ratio4.5%13.5%10.0%Tier 1 capital ratio6.0%15.0%11.5%Total capital ratio8.0%17.0%13.5%1.Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer requirement.Our risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of (i) the Standardized Approach and (ii) the Advanced Approach.

Beginning on January 1, 2020, we elected to defer the effect of the adoption of CECL on our risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts and ratios, as well as our RWA, adjusted average assets and supplementary leverage exposure calculations, over a five-year transition period. The deferral impacts began to phase in at 25% per year from January 1, 2022, were phased-in at 75% from January 1, 2024 and were fully phased-in from January 1, 2025.\n"

The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. For us to remain an FHC, we must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the Federal Reserve, and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards established by the OCC. In addition, many of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to regulatory capital requirements, including regulated subsidiaries registered as swap dealers with the CFTC or conditionally registered as security-based swap dealers with the SEC or registered as broker-dealers or futures commission merchants.

Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures, Other credit risk driven by higher deferred tax assets and securitizations, and growth in Equity investments, partially offset by a decrease in non-investment grade Corporate lending exposures.Market risk RWA increased in the current year period under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily driven by higher Regulatory Stressed VaR and Regulatory VaR, partially offset by lower incremental risk charges driven by decreased exposures to non-investment grade issuances.The decrease in Operational risk RWA in the current year period is primarily related to lower execution-related losses, partially offset by an increase in litigation-related losses in the second quarter.Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used.Required and Actual TLAC and Eligible LTD Ratios Actual Amount/Ratio$ in millionsRegulatory MinimumRequired Ratio1AtJune 30,2025 AtDecember 31,2024 External TLAC2$281,648 $266,146 External TLAC as a % of RWA18.0%21.5%53.8%55.8%External TLAC as a % of leverage exposure7.5%9.5%17.4%17.5%Eligible LTD3$178,832 $169,690 Eligible LTD as a % of RWA9.0%9.0%34.2%35.5%Eligible LTD as a % of leverage exposure4.5%4.5%11.0%11.2%1.Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. 2.External TLAC consists of CET1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 3.Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date.We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For a further discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital BufferThe Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR framework.We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As banks with less than $250 billion of total assets, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements.As part of its annual capital supervisory stress testing process, the Federal Reserve determines an SCB for each large BHC, including us.Our SCB will remain at 6.0% through September 30, 2025. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB resulted in an aggregate Standardized Approach CET1 required ratio of 13.5%.\n"

On June 27, 2025, the Federal Reserve published summary results of its supervisory stress tests of each large BHC, in which the post-stress CET1 decline in the severely adverse scenario decreased 90 basis points from the prior year annual supervisory stress test, from 4.6% to 3.7%. Following the publication of the supervisory stress test results, we announced that we expect, under current regulatory standards, to be subject to an SCB of 5.1% from October 1, 2025 through September 30, 2026. In addition to the projected decline in our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in the severely adverse scenario, our expected SCB incorporates the dividend add-on component. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this expected SCB would result in an aggregate Standardized Approach CET1 ratio of 12.6%. Generally, our SCB is determined annually based on the results of the supervisory stress test. On April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks. See “Regulatory Developments and Other Matters—Proposed Changes to Capital Requirements” herein. If relevant, the Firm will provide updated information on applicable regulatory capital standards in response to a final rulemaking, including any change in the Firm’s SCB.We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $1.00 per share from $0.925, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 16, 2025. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital Buffer” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the Required Capital Framework Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company common equity. We generally hold Parent Company common equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, potential future acquisitions and other capital needs.

Under the proposal, our SCB would be based, in part, on the average of the post-stress capital decline embedded in the Federal Reserve’s stress test results over two consecutive years. Additionally, the proposal would shift the annual effective date of the revised SCB from October 1 to January 1 of the following year and modify certain elements of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program. Proposed Changes to the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage RatioOn June 25, 2025, the U.S. banking agencies released a proposal to modify eSLR requirements applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their U.S. insured depository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries. If adopted, the proposal would modify the eSLR buffer applicable to U.S. G-SIBs to equal 50 percent of each BHC’s Method 1 G-SIB capital surcharge, applied above the 3.0% minimum SLR requirement, and would modify eSLR standards for U.S. G-SIBs’ IDI subsidiaries to have the same form and calibration as the BHC-level standard. As a result, under the proposal, the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries would each have been subject to a 3.5% SLR requirement (inclusive of a 0.5% eSLR buffer) as of June 30, 2025, as compared with current standards, which impose a 5.0% SLR requirement on the Firm (inclusive of a 2.0% eSLR buffer) and require the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet a 6.0% SLR requirement above the minimum 3.0% SLR requirement to be deemed “well capitalized.” The Federal Reserve has also proposed conforming modifications to the SLR component of TLAC and LTD requirements, which currently incorporate the U.S. G-SIB 2.0% eSLR buffer.

There were no trading loss days in the current quarter.\nTEXT: 95%/One-Day Management VaR for the Trading Portfolio\nTEXT: Three Months EndedJune 30, 2025$ in millionsPeriod EndAverageHigh1Low1Interest rate and credit spread$31 $30 $42 $20 Equity price33 27 43 17 Foreign exchange rate11 14 22 8 Commodity price16 16 26 12 Less: Diversification benefit2(37)(40)N/AN/APrimary Risk Categories$54 $47 $63 $34 Credit portfolio19 18 19 17 Less: Diversification benefit2(18)(15)N/AN/ATotal Management VaR$55 $50 $63 $38\nTABLE: TABLE: $ in millions Period End Average High1 Low1; Interest rate and credit spread $ 31 $ 30 $ 42 $ 20; Equity price 33 27 43 17; Foreign exchange rate 11 14 22 8; Commodity price 16 16 26 12; Less: Diversification benefit2 (37) (40) N/A N/A; Primary Risk Categories $ 54 $ 47 $ 63 $ 34; Credit portfolio 19 18 19 17; Less: Diversification benefit2 (18) (15) N/A N/A; Total Management VaR $ 55 $ 50 $ 63 $ 38.\nTEXT: Three Months EndedMarch 31, 2025$ in millionsPeriod EndAverageHigh1Low1Interest rate and credit spread$25 $30 $39 $22 Equity price23 23 26 19 Foreign exchange rate9 11 15 7 Commodity price22 17 27 12 Less: Diversification benefit2(40)(35)N/AN/APrimary Risk Categories$39 $46 $54 $39 Credit portfolio18 19 23 18 Less: Diversification benefit2(11)(15)N/AN/ATotal Management VaR$46 $50 $60 $43\nTABLE: TABLE: $ in millions Period End Average High1 Low1; Interest rate and credit spread $ 25 $ 30 $ 39 $ 22; Equity price 23 23 26 19; Foreign exchange rate 9 11 15 7; Commodity price 22 17 27 12; Less: Diversification benefit2 (40) (35) N/A N/A; Primary Risk Categories $ 39 $ 46 $ 54 $ 39; Credit portfolio 18 19 23 18; Less: Diversification benefit2 (11) (15) N/A N/A; Total Management VaR $ 46 $ 50 $ 60 $ 43.\nTEXT: 1.The high and low VaR values for the Total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and, therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.\nTEXT: 2.Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days. Similar diversification benefits are also taken into account within each component.\nTEXT: Average Total Management VaR and average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories were relatively unchanged from the three months ended March 31, 2025. Period-end Total Management VaR increased from March 31, 2025, primarily driven by increased exposures in the equity price and interest rate and credit spread categories.\nTEXT: Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues\nTEXT: We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units.
