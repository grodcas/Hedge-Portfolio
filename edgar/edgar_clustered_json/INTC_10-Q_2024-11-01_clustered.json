These initiatives include reducing headcount by approximately 16,500 employees as of Q3 2024, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio reviews of our businesses under a 'clean sheet' view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. We expect the total impact from headcount reduction initiatives to exceed 15% of our core Intel workforce by year end. As a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in Q3 2024 as follows:\nTEXT: ▪cash-based employee severance and related employee exit charges of $2.2 billion;\nTEXT: ▪non-cash charges directly resulting from our decision to exit manufacturing capabilities for internal-use test hardware, resulting in the impairment of certain construction in progress assets of $442 million; and\nTEXT: ▪non-cash charges associated with real estate consolidation and exits that resulted in the impairment of certain operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements of $86 million.\nTEXT: In Q3 2024, our consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\nTEXT: ▪$3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\nTEXT: ▪$2.9 billion of non-cash charges, all of which were recorded as other charges in the restructuring and other line as presented in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income, which were associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (combined with the restructuring charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, our restructuring and other charges totaled $5.6 billion in Q3 2024 — see \"Note 6: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements); and\nTEXT: ▪$9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 7: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements).\nTEXT: Our discussion regarding our segments' results of operations presented below excludes the $5.6 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our chief operating decision maker receives, views and uses information for decision making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\nTEXT: \"Note 2: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q provides additional information about our operating segments, including the nature of segment revenues and expenses, and reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total consolidated net revenues and our segment operating income (loss) presented below to our total consolidated operating income (loss) for each of the periods presented.\nTEXT: Separately, during and following Q3 2024, there has been a significant escalation in hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region. We continue to monitor the impact the geopolitical conflict could have on our operations in Israel, including potential disruption of our wafer fabrication facility and our product development centers. To date, while we have had a substantial number of our employees called for active military duty, we have not had a material interruption in either our manufacturing operations or our product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and equipment assets in Israel are self-insured and could be impacted from the conflict.\nTEXT: For additional key highlights of our results of operations, see \"A Quarter in Review.\"\n"

We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing leadership.

Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance.

These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.\nTEXT: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nTEXT: We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\" within MD&A in our 2023 Form 10-K.\nTEXT: Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nTEXT: Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nTEXT: Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nTEXT: Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nTEXT: Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nTEXT: There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nTEXT: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nTEXT: We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending September 28, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.\nTEXT: We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.\nTEXT: Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements\nTEXT: Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, no such plans or arrangements were adopted or terminated, including by modification.\nTEXT: Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n"

On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.\nTEXT: On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.\n"
