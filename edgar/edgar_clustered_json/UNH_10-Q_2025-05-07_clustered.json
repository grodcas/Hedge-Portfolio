Basis of Presentation\nTEXT: UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (individually and together with its subsidiaries, “UnitedHealth Group” and the “Company”) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. The Company’s two distinct, yet complementary businesses — Optum and UnitedHealthcare — are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations the Company is privileged to serve.\nTEXT: The Company has prepared the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements according to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and has included the accounts of UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries. The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. In accordance with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Company has omitted certain footnote disclosures that would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in its annual audited Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 as filed with the SEC (2024 10-K). The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present the interim financial statements fairly.\nTITLE: Use of Estimates\nTEXT: These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include certain amounts based on the Company’s best estimates and judgments. The Company’s most significant estimates relate to estimates and judgments for medical costs payable and goodwill. Certain of these estimates require the application of complex assumptions and judgments, often because they involve matters that are inherently uncertain and will likely change in subsequent periods.

The Company believes that it will timely collect the principal and interest due on its debt securities that have an amortized cost in excess of fair value. The unrealized losses were primarily caused by interest rate increases and not by unfavorable changes in the credit quality associated with these securities which impacted the Company’s assessment on collectability of principal and interest. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities for any credit-related impairment when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. The Company evaluated the expected cash flows, the underlying credit quality and credit ratings of the issuers, noting no significant credit deterioration since purchase. As of March 31, 2025, the Company did not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position. Therefore, the Company believes these losses to be temporary.

These matters include medical malpractice, employment, intellectual property, antitrust, privacy and contract claims and claims related to health care benefits coverage and other business practices.\nTEXT: The Company records liabilities for its estimates of probable costs resulting from these matters where appropriate. Estimates of costs resulting from legal and regulatory matters involving the Company are inherently difficult to predict, particularly where the matters: involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages or may involve fines, penalties or punitive damages; present novel legal theories or represent a shift in regulatory policy; involve a large number of claimants or regulatory bodies; are in the early stages of the proceedings; or could result in a change in business practices. Accordingly, the Company is often unable to estimate the losses or ranges of losses for those matters where there is a reasonable possibility or it is probable a loss may be incurred.\nTITLE: Government Investigations, Audits and Reviews\nTEXT: The Company has been involved or is currently involved in various governmental investigations, audits and reviews. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), state insurance and health and welfare departments, state attorneys general, the Office of the Inspector General, the Office of Personnel Management, the Office for Civil Rights, the Government Accountability Office, the Federal Trade Commission, U.S. Congressional committees, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Food and Drug Administration and other governmental authorities. Similarly, the Company’s international businesses are also subject to investigations, audits and reviews by applicable foreign governments. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and no assurance as to whether its business, financial condition or results of operations will be materially adversely affected. Certain of the Company’s businesses have been reviewed or are currently under review, including for, among other matters, compliance with coding and other requirements under the Medicare risk-adjustment model. CMS has selected certain of the Company’s local plans for risk adjustment data validation (RADV) audits to validate the coding practices of and supporting documentation maintained by health care providers and such audits may result in retrospective adjustments to payments made to the Company’s health plans.\nTEXT: On February 14, 2017, the DOJ announced its decision to pursue certain claims within a lawsuit initially asserted against the Company and filed under seal by a whistleblower in 2011. The whistleblower’s complaint, which was unsealed on February 15, 2017, alleges the Company made improper risk adjustment submissions and violated the False Claims Act. In March 2025, a Special Master appointed by the court issued a report recommending that the court enter summary judgment in the Company’s favor on all remaining claims. In April 2025, the DOJ filed a motion asking the court to reject the Special Master’s report. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the outcome which may result from this matter given its procedural status.\nTITLE: 7.

      "content": "ITEM 2:\nCLUSTER SUMMARY (KEYWORDS):\nmedical, care, health, medicare, cost, trends, costs, advantage, continue, rate\n\nTITLE: Business Trends\nTEXT: Our businesses participate primarily in the United States health markets. We expect overall spending on health care to continue to grow in the future, due to inflation, medical technology and pharmaceutical advancement, regulatory requirements, demographic trends in the population and national interest in health and well-being. The rate of market growth may be affected by a variety of factors, including macroeconomic conditions and regulatory changes, which could impact our results of operations, including our continued efforts to control health care costs.\nTEXT: Pricing Trends. To price our health care benefits, products and services, we start with our view of expected future costs, including medical care patterns, the mix and health status of people served, inflation and labor market dynamics. We frequently evaluate and adjust our approach in each of the local markets we serve, considering relevant factors, such as product positioning, price competitiveness and environmental, competitive, legislative and regulatory considerations, including minimum medical loss ratio thresholds and similar revenue adjustments. We will continue seeking to balance growth and profitability across all these dimensions.\nTEXT: The commercial risk market remains highly competitive in the small group, large group and individual segments. We expect broad-based competition to continue as the industry adapts to individual and employer needs.\nTEXT: Medicare Advantage funding continues to be pressured, as discussed below in “Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties” and we have observed increased care patterns as discussed below in “Medical Cost Trends,” which may impact pricing and benefit design in future periods.\nTEXT: The Medicaid redetermination process has caused a timing mismatch between the health status of people served through Medicaid and state rate updates. While the updated rates in 2025 more closely align with underlying member acuity, the funding and payment rate environment remains insufficient to meet the health needs of patients and creates the risk of continued downward pressure on Medicaid margin percentages. We continue to take a prudent, market-sustainable posture for both new business and maintenance of existing relationships. We continue to advocate for actuarially sound rates commensurate with our medical cost trends and we remain dedicated to partnering with those states that are committed to the long-term viability of their programs.\nTEXT: Medical Cost Trends. Our medical cost trends primarily relate to changes in unit costs, care activity and prescription drug costs. We have observed increased care patterns, more notably related to physician and outpatient care for seniors served through Medicare Advantage, that are above what we expected and contemplated in our benefits design. These elevated care patterns may continue in future periods. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) altered the Medicare Part D model and benefits, shifting more risk to plans, which results in both increased premiums and medical costs. The IRA also changed the quarterly relationship of medical costs to premiums, altering the seasonal progression and creating a more consistent relationship between medical costs and premiums throughout the year. We endeavor to mitigate medical cost increases by engaging hospitals, physicians and consumers with information and helping them make clinically sound choices, with the objective of helping them achieve high-quality, affordable care.\nTITLE: Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nTEXT: Medicare Advantage Rates. Medicare Advantage rate notices for numerous years have resulted in industry base rates well below the industry forward medical cost trend, with the Final Notice for 2026 beginning to approach the industry forward medical cost trend. The compounding impact of the previous multi-year rate shortfalls creates sustained pressure on the Medicare Advantage program. Further, substantial revisions to the risk adjustment model, which serves to adjust rates to reflect a patient’s health status and care resource needs, have and will result in reduced funding and potentially benefits for people, especially those with some of the greatest health and social challenges.\nTEXT: As a result of ongoing Medicare funding pressures, there are adjustments we can make to partially offset these rate pressures and reductions for a particular period. For example, we can seek to intensify our medical and operating cost management, make changes to the size and composition of our care provider networks, adjust member benefits and implement or increase the member premiums supplementing the monthly payments we receive from the government. Additionally, we decide annually on a county-by-county basis where we will offer Medicare Advantage plans.\nTITLE: SELECTED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT ITEMS\nTEXT: The following summarizes select first quarter 2025 year-over-year operating comparisons to first quarter 2024 and other financial results.\nTEXT: •Consolidated revenues grew 10%, UnitedHealthcare revenues grew 12% and Optum revenues grew 5%.\nTEXT: •UnitedHealthcare served 945,000 more people, driven by growth in commercial offerings and Medicare Advantage.\nTEXT: •Consolidated earnings from operations of $9.1 billion compared to $7.9 billion last year, with 2024 impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack.\nTEXT: •Diluted earnings per common share was $6.85.\nTEXT: •Cash flows from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2025 were $5.5 billion.\n"

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included net repayments of loans to care providers in response to the Change Healthcare cyberattack, decreased cash paid for acquisitions and increased net sales and maturities of investments, offset by decreased net issuances of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and decreased customer funds administered.\nTITLE: Financial Condition\nTEXT: As of March 31, 2025, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and marketable equity securities balances of $79.1 billion included approximately $30.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which $1.5 billion was available for general corporate use), $46.4 billion of debt securities and $1.9 billion of investments in marketable equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash and cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Our available-for-sale debt securities portfolio had a weighted-average duration of 4.2 years and a weighted-average credit rating of “Double A” as of March 31, 2025. When multiple credit ratings are available for an individual security, the average of the available ratings is used to determine the weighted-average credit rating.\nTITLE: Capital Resources and Uses of Liquidity\nTEXT: In addition to cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalent balances available for general corporate use, our capital resources and uses of liquidity are as follows:\nTEXT: Cash Requirements.

During the three months ended March 31, 2025, there were no material changes to this previously disclosed information outside the ordinary course of business.

We continually evaluate opportunities to expand our operations, including through internal development of new products, programs and technology applications and business combinations.\nTEXT: Short-Term Borrowings. Our revolving bank credit facilities provide liquidity support for our commercial paper borrowing program, which facilitates the private placement of unsecured debt through independent broker-dealers, and are available for general corporate purposes.
