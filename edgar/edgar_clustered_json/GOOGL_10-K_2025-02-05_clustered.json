Discussion of 2023 results compared to 2022 results to the extent not included in this report can be found in Item 7 of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTITLE: Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results\nTEXT: Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. For further details on our segments, see Part I, Item 1 Business and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTITLE: Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect\nTEXT: The following long-term trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to affect our future results:\nTITLE: •Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nTEXT: The continuing evolution of the online world has contributed to the growth of our business and our revenues since inception. We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues, although at a slower pace than we have experienced historically. In addition, we face increasing competition for user engagement and advertisers, including from other developers and providers of AI products and services, which may affect our revenues.\nTEXT: •Users continue to access our products and services using diverse devices and modalities, which allows for new advertising formats that may benefit our revenues but adversely affect our margins.\nTEXT: Our users are accessing our products and services via diverse devices and modalities beyond traditional desktop, such as smartphones, wearables, connected TVs, and smart home devices, and want to be able to be connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We are focused on expanding our products and services to stay in front of these trends in order to maintain and grow our business.\nTEXT: We benefit from advertising revenues generated from different channels, including mobile, and newer advertising formats. The margins from these channels and newer products have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. Additionally, as the market for a particular device type or modality matures, our advertising revenues may be affected. For example, changing dynamics within the global smartphone market, such as increased market saturation in developed countries, can affect our mobile advertising revenues.\nTEXT: We expect TAC paid to our distribution partners and Google Network partners to increase as our revenues grow and TAC as a percentage of our advertising revenues (\"TAC rate\") to be affected by changes in device mix; geographic mix; partner agreement terms; partner mix; the percentage of queries channeled through paid access points; product mix; the relative revenue growth rates of advertising revenues from different channels; and revenue share terms.\nTEXT: We expect these trends to continue to affect our revenues and put pressure on our margins.\nTITLE: •As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings, which may affect our monetization.\nTEXT: As interactions between users and advertisers change, and as online user behavior evolves, for example with AI, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve these changing needs, which may affect monetization of our products and services. We expect to continue to incorporate AI innovations into our products, such as AI in Search, that could affect our monetization trends. When developing new products and services we generally focus first on user experience and then on monetization.\nTEXT: •As users in developing economies increasingly come online, our revenues from international markets continue to increase, and may require continued investments. In addition, movements in foreign exchange rates affect such revenues.\nTEXT: The shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., including in emerging markets, such as India. We continue to invest heavily and develop localized versions of our products and advertising programs relevant to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: revenues from emerging markets. We expect that our results will continue to be affected by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available. This trend could affect our revenues as developing markets initially monetize at a lower rate than more mature markets.\nTEXT: International revenues represent a significant portion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n"

The margins on these revenues vary significantly and are generally lower than the margins on our advertising revenues. For example, sales of our devices adversely affect our consolidated margins due to pressures on pricing and higher cost of sales.\nTEXT: •As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\nTEXT: We continue to make significant research and development investments in areas of strategic focus as we seek to develop new, innovative offerings, improve our existing offerings, and rapidly and responsibly deploy AI across our businesses. We also expect to increase, relative to 2024, our investment in our technical infrastructure, including servers, network equipment, and data centers, to support the growth of our business and our long-term initiatives, in particular in support of AI products and services. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments remain important elements in our use of capital and contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, and build strong partnerships around strategic initiatives.\nTEXT: •We continue to face an evolving regulatory environment, and we are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and other forms of potential legal liability, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\nTEXT: Changes in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters, including investigations, lawsuits, and regulatory actions, have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, our products and services may become less useful, our ability to pursue certain business practices or offer certain products or services may be limited, and we may need to change our business models and operations to comply with evolving regulatory and legal matters.

Our operating expenses include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of our costs and expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally vest over four years.\n"

These investments are accounted for under the measurement alternative method (\"the measurement alternative\") and are measured at cost, less impairment, subject to upward and downward adjustments resulting from observable price changes for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These adjustments require quantitative assessments of the fair value of our securities, which may require the use of unobservable inputs. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and involve the use of estimates using the best information available, which may include cash flow projections or other available market data.\nTEXT: Non-marketable equity securities are also evaluated for impairment, based on qualitative factors including the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among others. When indicators of impairment exist, we prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach, which requires judgment and the use of unobservable inputs, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data of private and public companies, among others.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nTEXT: Recording an uncertain tax position involves various qualitative considerations, including evaluation of comparable and resolved tax exposures, applicability of tax laws, and likelihood of settlement. We evaluate uncertain tax positions periodically, considering changes in facts and circumstances, such as new regulations or recent judicial opinions, as well as the status of audit activities by taxing authorities. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: differences will affect the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nTEXT: The provision for income taxes includes the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nTITLE: Loss Contingencies\nTEXT: We are subject to claims, lawsuits, regulatory and government inquiries and investigations, other proceedings, and consent orders involving competition, intellectual property, data privacy and security, tax and related compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTEXT: We evaluate, on a regular basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material.\n"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nTEXT: We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 4, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nTITLE: Basis for Opinion\nTEXT: These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nTITLE: Critical Audit Matter\nTEXT: The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nTEXT: Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nTEXT: /s/ Ernst & Young LLPSan Jose, CaliforniaFebruary 4, 2025\nTABLE: TABLE: .\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\n"

Actual results could differ materially from these estimates due to uncertainties. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses; contingent liabilities; fair values of financial instruments and goodwill; income taxes; inventory; and useful lives of property and equipment, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable, and the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nTITLE: Revenue Recognition\nTEXT: Revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, and the collectibility of an amount that we expect in exchange for those goods or services is probable. Sales and other similar taxes are excluded from revenues.\nTITLE: Advertising Revenues\nTEXT: We generate advertising revenues primarily by delivering advertising on:\nTEXT: •Google Search and other properties, including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc. and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\nTEXT: •Google Network properties, including revenues from Google Network properties participating in AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nTEXT: Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through Google Ads, Google Ad Manager, Google Display & Video 360, and Google Marketing Platform, among others.\nTEXT: We offer advertising by delivering both performance and brand advertising. We recognize revenues for performance advertising when a user engages with the advertisement. For brand advertising, we recognize revenues when the ad is displayed, or a user views the ad.\nTEXT: For ads placed on Google Network properties, we evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis). Generally, we report advertising revenues for ads placed on Google Network properties on a gross basis, that is, the amounts billed to our customers are recorded as revenues, and amounts paid to Google Network partners are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers. Our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing.\nTITLE: Google Subscriptions, Platforms, and Devices\nTEXT: Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenues consist of revenues from:\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: •consumer subscriptions, which primarily include revenues from YouTube services, such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One;\nTITLE: •platforms, which primarily include revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases;\nTEXT: •devices, which primarily include sales of the Pixel family of devices; and\nTEXT: Subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the period of the subscription, primarily monthly. We report revenues from Google Play sales of apps and in-app purchases on a net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate a transaction between app developers and end users for which we earn a service fee.\nTITLE: Google Cloud Revenues\nTEXT: Google Cloud revenues consist of revenues from:\nTEXT: •Google Cloud Platform, which generates consumption-based fees and subscriptions for infrastructure, platform, and other services. These services provide access to solutions such as AI offerings including our AI infrastructure, Vertex AI platform, and Gemini for Google Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\nTEXT: •Google Workspace, which includes subscriptions for cloud-based communication and collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Drive, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\nTEXT: Our cloud services are generally provided on either a consumption or subscription basis and may have contract terms longer than a year. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis are recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nTITLE: Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nTEXT: Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, we allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers.\nTITLE: Customer Incentives and Credits\nTEXT: Certain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration related to customer incentives and credits.\nTITLE: Sales Commissions\nTEXT: We expense sales commissions when incurred when the period of the expected benefit is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions and amortize if the expected benefit period is greater than one year. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n"

Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products. As a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nTEXT: Software development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud-based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\nTITLE: Stock-based Compensation\nTEXT: Stock-based compensation (SBC) primarily consists of Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures as they occur. RSUs are awarded dividend equivalents, which are subject to the same vesting conditions as the underlying award, and settled in Class C shares.\nTEXT: For RSUs, shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory income tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued than the number of RSUs outstanding, and the income tax withholding is recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nTEXT: Additionally, SBC includes other stock-based awards, such as performance stock units (PSUs) that include market conditions and awards that may be settled in cash or the stock of certain Other Bet companies. PSUs and certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are equity classified and expense is recognized over the requisite service period. Certain awards granted by Other Bet companies are liability classified and remeasured at fair value through settlement. The fair value of awards granted by Other Bet companies is based on the equity valuation of the respective Other Bet company.\nTITLE: Advertising and Promotional Expenses\nTEXT: We expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $9.2 billion, $8.7 billion, and $8.7 billion, respectively.\nTITLE: Performance Fees\nTEXT: Performance fees refer to compensation arrangements with payouts based on realized returns from certain investments. We record compensation expense based on the estimated payouts on an ongoing basis, which may result in expense recognized before investment returns are realized and compensation is paid and may require the use of unobservable inputs. Performance fees are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nTITLE: Fair Value Measurements\nTEXT: Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nTEXT: Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nTEXT: Level 2 - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data.

Our financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried at cost with fair value disclosed, if required.\nTEXT: We measure certain other instruments, and certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination, also at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.\nTITLE: Financial Instruments\nTEXT: Our financial instruments include cash, cash equivalents, marketable and non-marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, accounts receivable, and convertible notes.\nTITLE: Credit Risks\nTEXT: We are subject to credit risk primarily from cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, derivative financial instruments, including foreign exchange contracts, accounts receivable, and convertible notes. We manage our credit risk exposure through timely assessment of our counterparty creditworthiness, credit limits, and use of collateral management. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. We manage our credit risk exposure by performing ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend. We generally do not require collateral from our customers.\nTITLE: Cash Equivalents\nTEXT: We invest excess cash primarily in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities, government bonds, money market funds, and time deposits.\nTITLE: Marketable Securities\nTEXT: We classify all marketable debt securities that have effective maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with effective maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these debt securities prior to their effective maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for the changes in allowance for expected credit losses, which are recorded in OI&E. For certain marketable debt securities we have elected the fair value option, for which changes in fair value are recorded in OI&E. We determine any realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable debt securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of OI&E.\nTEXT: Our investments in marketable equity securities are measured at fair value with the related gains and losses, including unrealized, recognized in OI&E. We classify our marketable equity securities subject to long-term lock-up restrictions beyond 12 months as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Non-Marketable Securities\nTEXT: Non-marketable securities primarily consist of equity securities. We account for non-marketable equity securities through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee under the equity method. Other non-marketable equity securities that we hold are primarily accounted for under the measurement alternative. Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value is measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based on a market approach as of the transaction date and are recorded as a component of OI&E.\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: Non-marketable securities that do not have effective contractual maturity dates are classified as other non-current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Derivative Financial Instruments\nTEXT: See Note 3 for the accounting policy pertaining to derivative financial instruments.\n"

The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customers, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Additionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed in advance of the right to invoice the customer.\nTEXT: We maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which is recorded as an offset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We assess collectibility by reviewing accounts receivable on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist and on an individual basis when we identify specific customers with known disputes or collectibility issues. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we consider historical collectibility based on past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions.\nTITLE: Convertible Notes\nTEXT: Our investments in convertible notes are primarily recorded at amortized cost which includes unpaid principal balances, deferred origination costs, and any related discount or premium, net of allowances for credit losses, and are included within other non-current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nTITLE: Other\nTEXT: Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments in companies with which we also entered into commercial arrangements at or near the same time. For these transactions, judgment is required in assessing the substance of the arrangements, including assessing whether the components of the arrangements should be accounted for as separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value of the components of the arrangements, including the fair value of the investments. Additionally, if our investment in such companies becomes impaired, we may need to re-evaluate the accounting for the commercial arrangement, including reducing any remaining performance obligations.\nTITLE: Impairment of Investments\nTEXT: We periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment.\nTEXT: For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether a credit loss exists. The credit loss is estimated by considering available information relevant to the collectibility of the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss is recorded as a charge to OI&E, not to exceed the amount of the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized in AOCI. If we have an intent to sell, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a debt security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we will write down the security to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E.\nTEXT: For non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, we consider whether impairment indicators exist by evaluating the companies' financial and liquidity position and access to capital resources, among other indicators. If the assessment indicates that the investment is impaired, we write down the investment to its fair value by recording the corresponding charge as a component of OI&E. We prepare quantitative measurements of the fair value of our equity investments using a market approach or an income approach.\nTITLE: Inventory\nTEXT: Inventory consists primarily of finished goods and is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Cost is computed using the first-in, first-out method.\nTITLE: Variable Interest Entities\nTEXT: We determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interests is considered a variable interest entity (VIE).

Technical infrastructure includes data center land, buildings and leasehold improvements, and servers and network equipment. Office space includes office land, buildings and leasehold improvements. Assets not yet in service are those that are not ready for our intended use, including data center buildings and servers in the process of construction or assembly.\nTEXT: Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation commences once assets are ready for our intended use and is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which we regularly evaluate for factors such as technological obsolescence and our planned use and utilization. We depreciate data center and office buildings over periods of seven to 40 years. We depreciate servers and network equipment generally over a period of six years. We depreciate corporate and other assets over periods of two to 25 years. We depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Land is not depreciated.\nTITLE: Goodwill\nTEXT: We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units periodically, as well as when changes in our operating segments occur. For changes in reporting units, we reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented.\nTITLE: Leases\nTEXT: We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. We combine fixed payments for non-lease components with lease payments and account for them together as a single lease component which increases the amount of our lease assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: Certain lease agreements contain variable payments, which are expensed as incurred and not included in the lease assets and liabilities. These amounts primarily include payments affected by the Consumer Price Index, and payments for maintenance and utilities.\nTEXT: Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our incremental borrowing rate, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. Our lease terms include periods under options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We generally use the base, non-cancelable, lease term when determining the lease assets and liabilities. Lease assets also include any prepaid lease payments and lease incentives.\nTEXT: Lease assets and liabilities are included on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and the long-term portion is included in operating lease liabilities. Finance lease assets are included in property and equipment, net. Finance lease liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities or other long-term liabilities.\nTEXT: Operating lease expense (excluding variable lease costs) is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the asset, and interest expense is recognized based on the incremental borrowing rate.\nTITLE: Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nTEXT: We review leases, property and equipment, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the carrying value of the assets or asset group is not recoverable, the impairment recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value.\n"

We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized or release a valuation allowance to increase deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that they will be realized. We have elected to account for the tax effects of the global intangible low tax income provision as a current period expense.\nTEXT: We recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nTITLE: Business Combinations\nTEXT: We include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of the acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, except for revenue contracts acquired, which are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The excess of the purchase price over the fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.\nTITLE: Foreign Currency\nTEXT: We translate the financial statements of our international subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in AOCI as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange gain (loss) in OI&E.\nTITLE: Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nTEXT: In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-09 \"Income Taxes (Topics 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\" to expand the disclosure requirements for income taxes. Upon adoption we will be required to disclose additional specified categories in the rate reconciliation in both percentage and dollar amounts. We will also be required to disclose the amount of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other disclosure requirements. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. We will adopt the standard in our 2025 annual period and are currently assessing the effect that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures.\nTEXT: In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03 \"Income Statement: Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\" to improve the disclosures about an entity’s expenses. Upon adoption, we will be required to disclose in the notes to the financial statements a disaggregation of certain expense categories included within the expense captions on the face of the income statement. The standard is effective for our 2027 annual period, and our interim periods beginning in 2028, with early adoption permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.

Revenue backlog represents commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenue. We expect to recognize approximately half of the revenue backlog as revenues over the next 24 months with the remainder to be recognized thereafter. The estimated revenue backlog and timing of revenue recognition for these commitments is largely driven by our ability to deliver in accordance with relevant contract terms and when our customers utilize services.

We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate.\nTEXT: Certain outstanding matters seek speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts, substantial changes to our business practices and products, or structural remedies. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being a loss and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters, and we may be unable to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of losses.

Additionally, in January 2023, the DOJ, along with a number of state Attorneys General, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to its advertising technology, and a number of additional state Attorneys General subsequently joined the lawsuit.

The presiding judge issued a remedies decision in October 2024, ordering a variety of alterations to our business models and operations and contractual agreements for Android and Google Play.

As a result, we may have to change our business practices and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.

We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.\nTEXT: See Note 14 for information regarding income tax contingencies.\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nTEXT: Our Board of Directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate, respectively.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes, respectively.\nTEXT: We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2021 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\nTEXT: The tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nTEXT: We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nTEXT: We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\nTITLE: Table of ContentsAlphabet Inc.\nTITLE: Alphabet Inc.\nTEXT: As announced in April 2024, we consolidated teams that focus on building general AI models across Google Research and Google DeepMind to further accelerate our progress in AI. General AI model development teams previously under Google Research in our Google Services segment are reported within Alphabet-level activities prospectively beginning in the second quarter of 2024. As further announced, in October 2024, the Gemini app team that is developing the direct consumer interface to our Gemini models joined Google DeepMind. The costs associated with the Gemini app team continue to be reported within our Google Services segment.\nTEXT: Certain costs are not allocated to our segments because they represent Alphabet-level activities. These costs primarily include certain AI-focused shared R&D activities, including development costs of our general AI models; corporate initiatives such as our philanthropic activities; corporate shared costs such as certain finance, human resource, and legal costs, including certain fines and settlements. Charges associated with employee severance and office space reductions during 2023 and 2024 were also not allocated to our segments. Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are not allocated to our segments.\nTEXT: Our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is our Chief Executive Officer, Sundar Pichai. Our CODM uses segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to our segments in our annual planning process and to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual results versus the annual plan. Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.\nTEXT: The following table presents revenue, profitability, and expense information about our segments (in millions):\nTEXT: Year Ended December 31,202220232024Revenues:Google Services$253,528 $272,543 $304,930 Google Cloud26,280 33,088 43,229 Other Bets1,068 1,527 1,648 Hedging gains (losses)1,960 236 211 Total revenues$282,836 $307,394 $350,018 Operating income (loss):Google Services$82,699 $95,858 $121,263 Google Cloud(1,922)1,716 6,112 Other Bets(4,636)(4,095)(4,444)Alphabet-level activities(1,299)(9,186)(10,541)Total income from operations$74,842 $84,293 $112,390 Supplemental information about our segment expenses:Google Services:Employee compensation expenses$43,529 $46,224 $44,560 Other costs and expenses127,300 130,461 139,107 Total Google Services costs and expenses$170,829 $176,685 $183,667 Google Cloud:Employee compensation expenses$16,132 $19,054 $20,519 Other costs and expenses12,070 12,318 16,598 Total Google Cloud costs and expenses$28,202 $31,372 $37,117\nTABLE: TABLE: 2022 2023 2024; Google Services $ 253,528 $ 272,543 $ 304,930; Google Cloud 26,280 33,088 43,229; Other Bets 1,068 1,527 1,648; Hedging gains (losses) 1,960 236 211; Total revenues $ 282,836 $ 307,394 $ 350,018; Google Services $ 82,699 $ 95,858 $ 121,263; Google Cloud (1,922) 1,716 6,112; Other Bets (4,636) (4,095) (4,444); Alphabet-level activities (1,299) (9,186) (10,541); Total income from operations $ 74,842 $ 84,293 $ 112,390; Employee compensation expenses $ 43,529 $ 46,224 $ 44,560; Other costs and expenses 127,300 130,461 139,107; Total Google Services costs and expenses $ 170,829 $ 176,685 $ 183,667; Employee compensation expenses $ 16,132 $ 19,054 $ 20,519; Other costs and expenses 12,070 12,318 16,598; Total Google Cloud costs and expenses $ 28,202 $ 31,372 $ 37,117.\nTITLE: Year Ended December 31,\n"
