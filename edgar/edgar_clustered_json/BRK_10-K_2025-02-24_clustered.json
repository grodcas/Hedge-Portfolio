We cannot reliably predict the future economic effects of these factors or events on our businesses.\nTEXT: Insurance underwriting generated after-tax earnings of $9.0 billion in 2024 and $5.4 billion in 2023 and losses of $30 million in 2022. Earnings in 2024 and 2023 benefited from significantly improved operating results at GEICO, which generated a significant loss in 2022. Underwriting results in 2024 also included estimated claims from Hurricanes Helene and Milton ($1.2 billion after-tax) and accruals in connection with a bankruptcy settlement agreement related to a non-insurance affiliate. Underwriting results in 2023 and 2022 included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events of approximately $725 million and $2.4 billion, respectively. After-tax earnings from insurance investment income increased $4.1 billion in 2024 and $3.1 billion in 2023 compared to corresponding prior years, driven by higher interest income from short-term investments.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of BNSF declined 1.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 and 14.4% in 2023 compared to 2022. Earnings in 2024 benefited from higher unit volume, improvements in employee productivity and lower other operating costs, and were negatively impacted by charges related to a labor agreement in the fourth quarter of 2024 and litigation charges related to an ongoing legal case. The decrease in 2023 was primarily attributable to lower overall freight volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business increased $1.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 and declined $1.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase in 2024 reflected lower estimated wildfire loss accruals at PacifiCorp and higher earnings from natural gas pipelines, primarily due to reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, and other energy businesses. The earnings decline in 2023 reflected increased estimated wildfire loss accruals, as well as lower earnings from other energy and real estate brokerage businesses compared to 2022.\nTEXT: Earnings from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses decreased 2.2% in 2024 compared to 2023 and increased 6.8% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings decline in 2024 reflected lower earnings from our service and retailing businesses, partially offset by earnings increases at several of our manufacturing businesses. The earnings increase in 2023 reflected increases at certain industrial products manufacturers and service businesses, the full year impact of Alleghany’s non-insurance businesses acquired in 2022 and earnings from Pilot Travel Centers for the eleven months ending December 31, 2023, partially offset by lower earnings at several of our other manufacturing businesses and at certain of our service and retailing businesses.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Results of Operations\nTEXT: Investment gains (losses) predominantly derive from our investments in equity securities and include significant unrealized gains and losses from changes in market prices and foreign currency exchange rates applicable to certain of our investments. We believe that investment gains and losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported periodic results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. Investment gains in 2023 also included an after-tax non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $2.4 billion related to our previously held 38.6% interest in Pilot through the application of the acquisition accounting method.\nTEXT: Other earnings included after-tax foreign currency exchange rate gains of $1.1 billion in 2024, $211 million in 2023 and $1.3 billion in 2022 related to the non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”).\n"

Further, we generally do not retrocede the risks we assume. We currently consider consolidated pre-tax losses exceeding $150 million from an event occurring in the current year to be significant. Significant events in 2024 included Hurricanes Milton and Helene, while significant events in 2023 included a cyclone and floods in New Zealand and a hailstorm in Italy. In 2022, significant events were Hurricane Ian and floods in Australia. In January 2025, several wildfires broke out in Southern California resulting in thousands of destroyed or damaged structures. We preliminarily estimate our insurance group could incur pre-tax losses of approximately $1.3 billion from these wildfires. Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated assets and liabilities can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results.\nTEXT: We write primary insurance and reinsurance policies covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and health risks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”). We strive to generate pre-tax underwriting earnings (defined as premiums earned less insurance losses/benefits incurred and underwriting expenses) over the long term in all business categories, except in our retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses. Time-value-of-money is an important consideration in establishing premiums for these policies, which we normally receive at the contract inception date. Claim and benefit payments can extend for decades and are expected to exceed premiums, producing underwriting losses over the claim settlement periods through changes in deferred charge assets established on retroactive reinsurance contracts and accretion of discounted annuity liabilities, as well as changes in the estimated ultimate liabilities.\nTEXT: Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).\nTABLE: TABLE_ROW: GEICO — 2024: 7,813; 2023: 3,635; 2022: (1,880\nTABLE_ROW: Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group — 2024: 855; 2023: 1,374; 2022: 393\nTABLE_ROW: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group — 2024: 2,737; 2023: 1,904; 2022: 1,465\nTABLE_ROW: Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss) — 2024: 11,405; 2023: 6,913; 2022: (22\nTABLE_ROW: Income taxes and noncontrolling interests — 2024: 2,385; 2023: 1,485; 2022: 8\nTABLE_ROW: Net underwriting earnings (loss) — 2024: 9,020; 2023: 5,428; 2022: (30\nTABLE_ROW: Effective income tax rate — 2024: 20.9; 2023: 21.5\nTITLE: 2024 2023 2022\nTITLE: 2024\nTITLE: 2023\nTITLE: 2022\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss):\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss)\nTEXT: Income taxes and noncontrolling interests\nTEXT: Net underwriting earnings (loss)\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: GEICO writes property and casualty policies, primarily private passenger automobile insurance, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

These effects were partially offset by less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates, increases in average claims severities and losses from catastrophe events.\nTEXT: Premiums written increased $3.1 billion (7.7%) in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting an increase in average written premiums per auto policy of 7.8%, primarily attributable to rate increases, partially offset by a 0.5% decrease in policies-in-force over the past year. The rate of decline in policies-in-force slowed in the first half of 2024, with growth experienced in the second half of the year.

GEICO’s loss ratio (losses and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned) was 71.8% in 2024 and 81.0% in 2023. The loss ratio decline reflected the impact of higher average earned premiums per auto policy and lower claims frequencies, partially offset by increases in average claims severities and less favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates.\nTEXT: Claims frequencies declined in 2024 versus 2023 for property damage (two to three percent range) and collision (eight to nine percent range) coverages, with bodily injury down slightly. Average claims severities increased in 2024 for property damage and collision (two to five percent range) and bodily injury coverages (eight to ten percent range) compared to 2023. Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in 2024 from Hurricanes Helene and Milton were approximately $360 million. Reductions in the ultimate loss estimates for prior accident years’ claims were $550 million in 2024 compared to $1.5 billion in 2023.\nTEXT: Underwriting expenses increased 7.7% in 2024 compared to 2023. GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expense to premiums earned) was 9.7% in 2024, unchanged from 2023, as improved operating efficiencies and increased operating leverage were offset by increased advertising expenses. The earnings from GEICO’s insurance agency (third-party commissions, net of operating expenses) are included as a reduction of underwriting expenses.\nTEXT: GEICO’s pre-tax underwriting earnings increase in 2023 reflected higher average premiums per auto policy, lower claims frequencies, more favorable development of prior accident years’ claims estimates and lower advertising costs. However, average claims severities increased in 2023 due to higher auto repair parts prices, labor costs and medical inflation. GEICO sought rate increases in numerous states in 2022 and 2023 in response to accelerating claims costs.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Insurance—Underwriting\nTEXT: Premiums written increased $730 million (1.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting higher average premiums per auto policy (16.8%) due to rate increases, partially offset by a 9.8% decrease in policies-in-force.

Average claim severities increased for property damage (fourteen to sixteen percent range), collision (four to six percent range) and bodily injury (five to seven percent range).

The increases at NICO Primary and BHHC were primarily attributable to commercial auto coverage, while the increase at BH Direct reflected growth across several product lines.

The comparative decline reflected a significant increase in loss estimates at GUARD and lower reductions in estimated losses across several of our other businesses that write medical professional liability and commercial liability coverages, partially offset by increased reductions of property loss estimates. During 2024, due to deteriorating loss experience, management at GUARD performed a comprehensive review of claims and significantly increased estimated ultimate claim liabilities. The reduction of favorable development of prior years’ liability claims estimates across our other businesses was attributable to unfavorable social inflation trends, including the impacts of jury awards and litigation costs.

The increase in 2023 was derived from higher estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims, which net of changes in deferred charges, produced a pre-tax loss of $650 million in 2023. The net effects of the increases in ultimate claim liabilities in 2024 and 2022 were relatively insignificant.\nTEXT: Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $2.2 billion in 2024 to $32.4 billion on December 31, 2024, primarily due to loss payments. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts declined $698 million in 2024 to $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024. Deferred charge balances will be charged to earnings over the expected remaining claims settlement periods.\nTEXT: Periodic payment annuity business is price and demand sensitive and the supply of available business is affected by the timing of underlying legal claim settlements. In 2023 and 2024, premium rates for new business were at unacceptable levels and we wrote no new business in either year.\nTEXT: Pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts in each period included the accretion of discounted liabilities, including liabilities for contracts without life contingencies, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses on non-U.S. Dollar denominated contracts. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates were insignificant in 2024 and produced pre-tax losses of $60 million in 2023 and pre-tax gains of $71 million in 2022. Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency effects were $596 million in 2024, $590 million in 2023 and $694 million in 2022. Pre-tax losses included a loss of approximately $130 million in 2022 from the settlement of a terminated reinsurance contract. Periodic payment annuity liabilities were $14.3 billion at December 31, 2024, including liabilities of $4.0 billion for contracts without life contingencies, and excluding the effects of discount rate changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nTEXT: Our variable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $157 million in 2024, $233 million in 2023 and $467 million in 2022. Earnings are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

The decreases reflected the impact of net reductions in our equity security holdings, partially offset by higher dividend rates on certain of our holdings. Dividend income varies from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends from certain investees.\nTEXT: Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and net liabilities assumed under insurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and certain other liabilities, which are reduced by insurance premiums receivable, reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. The effect of discount rate changes on long-duration insurance contracts, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, are excluded from float, as such amounts are not included in earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nTEXT: Float was approximately $171 billion at December 31, 2024, $169 billion at December 31, 2023 and $164 billion at December 31, 2022. The cost of float is measured as the ratio of pre-tax underwriting earnings to float balances. Our combined insurance operations generated pre-tax underwriting gains in 2024 and 2023, and the average cost of float was negative in each year.

Pre-tax earnings were $6.6 billion in 2024, a slight increase from 2023. Railroad operating earnings in 2024 increased due to volume growth and lower operating costs from improved productivity, partially offset by a $290 million charge related to a labor agreement that was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2024 and by increased litigation accruals.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products increased 7.1% in 2024 to $8.4 billion compared to 2023, reflecting a volume increase of 16.2% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher intermodal shipments from west coast imports and volumes from a new intermodal customer.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products declined 1.2% in 2024 to $5.6 billion from 2023, reflecting slight declines in volume and average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower aggregates, taconite, minerals and waste shipments, substantially offset by higher plastics and petroleum products volumes.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Burlington Northern Santa Fe\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 4.5% to $5.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to a volume increase of 7.4%, partially offset by lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to higher grain, renewable fuels and fertilizer shipments.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal decreased 22.5% to $2.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 17.9% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline was primarily due to lower natural gas prices.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $15.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $173 million (1.1%) compared to 2023. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 0.4 percentage points to 68.0% in 2024 versus 2023. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $356 million (6.5%) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $290 million charge related to a one-time payment included in the agreement with the SMART-TD labor union that was finalized in December 2024. This agreement allows BNSF the ability to redeploy brakepersons to conductors and engineers, which will allow BNSF to meet short-term hiring demands. Fuel expenses declined $417 million (11.3%) compared to 2023, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, partially offset by higher volumes. Railroad purchased services, equipment rents, materials and other expenses declined $126 million (3.0%), primarily due to cost reductions across numerous spend categories and lower property taxes, partially offset by a litigation charge in 2024 related to a judgment in an ongoing legal case with the Swinomish Tribe, which BNSF has appealed.\nTEXT: Railroad operating revenues declined 6.9% in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting lower overall volumes (5.7%) and average revenue per car/unit (0.6%), which was primarily attributable to lower fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by favorable price and mix. Pre-tax earnings were $6.6 billion in 2023, a decline of 14.2% from 2022, reflecting lower volumes and higher non-fuel operating costs, partially offset by lower fuel costs.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from consumer products declined 14.7% in 2023 to $7.9 billion compared to 2022, reflecting a volume decrease of 8.4% and lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower intermodal shipments resulting from reduced West Coast imports, the loss of an intermodal customer and competition from lower spot rates in the domestic trucking market, which negatively impacted demand. These declines were partially offset by an increase in automotive volume.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.7 billion in 2023, an increase of 1.8% from 2022, reflecting higher average revenue per car/unit, partially offset by a volume decrease of 0.8%. The volume decline was primarily due to lower demand for chemicals, plastics, minerals, paper and lumber, partially offset by increased shipments of steel and aggregates.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from agricultural products decreased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, attributable to a volume decrease of 2.9%, partially offset by slightly higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower grain exports, partially offset by higher volumes of domestic grains and feedstocks and renewable diesel.\nTEXT: Operating revenues from coal declined 3.4% to $3.8 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The revenue decrease was attributable to a volume decrease of 4.0%, partially offset by higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume decline reflected moderating demand attributable to lower natural gas prices.\nTEXT: Railroad operating expenses were $16.1 billion in 2023, a decline of $541 million (3.3%) compared to 2022. The ratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues increased 2.5 percentage points to 68.4% in 2023 versus 2022. Fuel expenses declined $897 million (19.6%) compared to 2022, reflecting lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved efficiency. Railroad compensation and benefits expenses increased $247 million (4.7%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher headcount and wage inflation.

The increase reflected higher retail customer rates in certain territories and higher retail customer volumes, partially offset by higher energy costs and lower wholesale volumes and prices. Retail customer volumes increased 3.6% overall (up 6.5% at NV Energy, 3.1% at PacifiCorp and 1.2% at MEC) in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in customer usage and the average number of customers, partially offset by an overall unfavorable impact of weather. The increase in other energy operating expenses was primarily due to higher vegetation management and other wildfire mitigation costs, insurance expenses and general and plant maintenance costs. Interest expense increased $314 million in 2024 over 2023, largely due to increased borrowings, including $4.4 billion of subsidiary term debt issued in January 2024 with a weighted average interest rate of 5.5%.\nTEXT: Net earnings of natural gas pipelines increased $153 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in earnings reflected reductions in earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by the impact of a higher effective income tax rate, due to the acquisition of an additional 50% limited partner interest in Cove Point on September 1, 2023. Pre-tax earnings of the natural gas pipelines in 2024 were unchanged from 2023.\nTEXT: Net earnings of other energy businesses increased $310 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher earnings at Northern Powergrid, partially offset by lower earnings from the renewable energy business. The increase at Northern Powergrid was attributable to higher distribution revenue due to higher tariffs from inflation adjustments and lower income tax expense attributable to charges recognized in 2023 for the U.K. Energy Profits Levy and a group relief tax benefit recognized in 2024, partially offset by unfavorable results from the upstream gas exploration and production business and higher operating expenses. Earnings from the renewable energy business decreased mainly due to lower earnings from wind tax equity investments in 2024 and debt extinguishment gains recognized in 2023.\nTEXT: Net earnings of real estate brokerage decreased $120 million 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to charges in connection with the ongoing real estate industry litigation matters.

Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2024 were 16.8%, an increase of 0.5 percentage points compared to 2023.\nTEXT: PCC’s revenues were $10.4 billion in 2024, an increase of 12.0% compared to 2023. The revenue increase was primarily attributable to higher demand for aerospace products, and to a lesser degree, power generation products. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth and considerable demand for air travel and aerospace products. PCC’s pre-tax earnings increased 24.4% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to sales increases and improved manufacturing and operating efficiencies. Continued growth in revenues and earnings will be predicated on PCC’s ability to successfully increase production levels to match the expected growth in aerospace products, as well as from improvements in industry supply chains and labor relations, which have been constraining commercial aircraft production at original equipment manufacturers.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2024, relatively unchanged compared to 2023, as higher volumes were essentially offset by lower selling prices and unfavorable product mix. Sales volumes in 2024 increased 4% compared to 2023, reflecting higher volumes in both the additives and advanced materials businesses.

The largest revenue declines were experienced by the Transportation Products group (18.2%), attributable to volume declines in the truck, trailer, and aftermarket automotive markets, as well as the Metal Services group (13.9%) and Retail Solutions group (9.4%), primarily due to reduced volume and changes in sales mix. Conversely, Electrical group revenues increased 6.0% due to higher copper prices and increased volumes. The Rail & Leasing group revenues increased 10.5% due to higher average lease renewal rates and increased railcar repair prices and volumes.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings declined 8.7% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower earnings from the Transportation Products, Metals Services and Retail Solutions groups due to the revenue declines, as well as lower earnings from the Crane Services group, attributable to lower revenues and higher costs, and the Electrical group, reflecting higher materials costs and unfavorable business mix changes. These declines were partially offset by higher earnings in the Rail & Leasing, Medical, Water Technologies and Foodservice Technologies groups.\nTEXT: IMC’s revenues were approximately $3.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of 2.2% compared to 2023. The decline reflected lower organic sales attributable to sluggish customer demand across all major regions, and unfavorable foreign currency translation from a stronger U.S. Dollar, partially offset by the impact of business acquisitions and higher investment income. The decline in organic sales was attributable to weaker general economic conditions and ongoing geopolitical conflicts. IMC’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.8% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily attributable to lower sales and gross margin rates and increased selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher investment and other income.

PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $1.5 billion in 2023, an increase of 30.0% compared to 2022 attributable to increases in sales and manufacturing and operating efficiencies in aerospace businesses, partially offset by operating losses in energy products businesses.\nTEXT: Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 4.0% compared to 2022. The revenue decline was primarily due to a 7.9% decline in volumes and unfavorable foreign currency effects, partially offset by higher selling prices. Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2023 were relatively unchanged compared to 2022. Earnings included insurance recoveries of $11 million in 2023 and $242 million in 2022 in connection with fires at the Rockton, Illinois facility in 2021 and the Rouen, France facility in 2019.

Business acquisitions represented substantially all of the comparative revenue increase. In addition, the Rail & Leasing, Water Technologies, Medical, Metal Services and Crane Services groups generated higher revenues, primarily due to higher volumes and pricing improvements. Revenues in 2023 of the Electrical group’s building wire business and the Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups were negatively impacted by lower metals prices, while revenues of the Transportation Products group reflected declining demand, particularly in the second half of the year.\nTEXT: Marmon’s pre-tax earnings increased 13.1% in 2023 compared to 2022. The earnings increase in 2023 reflected the impacts from business acquisitions ($90 million) and losses of $90 million in 2022 from the shutdown of the Rail & Leasing group business in Russia.

Also, financial services revenues increased 15.5% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increased interest income from higher average loan balances. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $27.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, an increase of 14.0% since December 31, 2023. Loan portfolio balances are largely funded by borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates.\nTEXT: Clayton Homes’ pre-tax earnings declined $115 million (5.6%) in 2024 compared to 2023, attributable to lower earnings from financial services (4.4%) and manufacturing activities (9.4%). The decline in financial services earnings reflected increased losses from homeowner property insurance claims, increased expected loan loss provisions due to higher loan originations, higher interest expense on borrowings from Berkshire finance affiliates. Interest expense increased $203 million (38%) in 2024 versus 2023, as borrowings from affiliates increased $6.6 billion in 2024 to $24.3 billion at December 31, 2024. The corresponding interest income on such borrowings is included in the “Other” earnings section on page K-54.

Forest River revenues increased 6.4% in 2024, reflecting a 7.9% increase in unit sales, which included the impact of business acquisitions in 2024 and 2023. Average selling prices for recreational vehicles declined and increased for bus and commercial vehicles, primarily attributable to changes in product mix. Brooks Sports and Duracell revenues increased 9.1% and 2.5%, respectively, in 2024 versus 2023. The revenue reductions at Fruit of the Loom and Richline were attributable to lower sales volumes, whereas the decline at Garan was attributable to lower average selling prices.\nTEXT: Consumer products group pre-tax earnings increased $172 million (10.9%) in 2024 versus 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings from our apparel and footwear businesses and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from Jazwares. Apparel and footwear earnings increased 37.0% in 2024 from 2023, primarily due to gross sales margin rate increases from lower sales markdowns, lower manufacturing costs and increased gains on asset sales, as well as from the favorable effects of past restructuring and cost management efforts. The earnings increase at Duracell was attributable to increased gross sales margins and lower selling, general and administrative expenses, including lower restructuring costs. The decline in earnings from Jazwares in 2024 was primarily due to increased amortization expense, as well as reduced orders from retailers during the fourth quarter.\nTEXT: Consumer products group revenues declined $1.5 billion (9.4%) in 2023 versus 2022.

BHA’s pre-tax earnings declined 7.9% in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to lower vehicle gross profit margins, partially offset by higher earnings from finance/service contract and parts/service/repair operations, as well as lower selling, general and administrative expenses. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $242 million (40.2%) in 2024 compared to 2023. Most of these other retailers generated significantly lower earnings in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower sales and gross sales margin rates and higher selling, general and administrative expenses as percentages of sales.\nTEXT: Retailing group revenues increased $111 million (0.6%) in 2023 compared to 2022, reflecting an increase at BHA, partially offset by lower revenues from our other retailers.

Revenues from BHA’s parts/service/repair operations increased 6.6% in 2023 versus 2022. Revenues of our other retailing businesses declined 5.6% in the aggregate versus 2022, due primarily to an 8.6% decline at our home furnishings businesses.\nTEXT: Retailing group pre-tax earnings were $1.7 billion in 2023, unchanged from 2022. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 17.7%, primarily due to earnings increases from the parts/service/repair and finance/service contract operations, as well as from higher investment income and lower selling, general and administrative and other expenses, partially offset by lower vehicle gross profit margin rates and higher floor plan interest expense. BHA’s comparative vehicle gross profit margin rates peaked in mid-2022 and declined through 2023. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group declined $168 million (21.8%) in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to a 28.3% decrease in home furnishings businesses earnings and the impact of a gain in 2022 from the divestiture of certain jewelry stores.\nTEXT: Pilot Travel Centers (“Pilot”) operates travel centers, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, and fuel-only retail locations.

Interest expense declined 30.9% in 2024 compared to the full year 2023, attributable to reduced borrowings and lower rates. In March 2024, Pilot borrowed $5.7 billion from certain Berkshire insurance subsidiaries and repaid its third-party borrowings.

McLane also operates businesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The retail and restaurant businesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. The retail business sales represented 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2024 with the restaurant business generating most of the remainder. These businesses have several significant customers and a reduction in purchasing by any of these customers could have an adverse impact on McLane’s revenues and earnings.\nTEXT: Revenues declined 1.3% in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting lower restaurant business sales (5.7%) and increased retail business sales (1.0%) in 2024 compared to 2023. The decline in restaurant sales reflected lower unit sales attributable to changing consumer preferences for dining at restaurants and quick-service restaurants versus meals-at-home, partially offset by impacts of price inflation. Pre-tax earnings increased $179 million (39.3%) in 2024 compared to 2023 reflecting an increase in gross sales margin rates, which more than offset the impacts of lower sales and higher selling, general and administrative expenses.\nTEXT: Revenues were $52.6 billion in 2023, a decline of $602 million (1.1%) compared to 2022. Revenues from the retail and restaurant businesses declined 0.8% and 2.2%, respectively, while revenues from the beverage business increased 1.9% compared to 2022. Retail and the restaurant business revenues were negatively affected in 2023 by lower unit volumes. Pre-tax earnings increased $184 million (67.9%) in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase reflected a slight increase in overall gross sales margin rates, increased other income and lower fuel expenses, partly offset by higher personnel expenses.\nTITLE: Non-Controlled Businesses\nTEXT: After-tax earnings of our non-controlled businesses include our proportionate share of earnings from our investments in Kraft Heinz, Occidental Petroleum (“Occidental”), Berkadia and Pilot through January 31, 2023.

Earnings of non-controlled businesses increased $222 million in 2023 compared to 2022. The comparative increase was primarily due to increased earnings from Occidental, on which we adopted the equity method on August 4, 2022, and Kraft Heinz ($240 million), partially offset by decreased earnings from Pilot ($559 million). As of January 31, 2023, we discontinued using the equity method for our pre-existing 38.6% interest in Pilot upon acquiring a controlling interest in Pilot.

We are not committed to a minimum or subject to a maximum repurchase amount. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces our consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills holdings to below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity will always be of paramount importance at Berkshire.

Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $21.1 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from December 31, 2023. At various dates in 2024, Berkshire issued approximately ¥837.4 billion (approximately $5.5 billion) of senior note issuances and term loan agreements. The borrowings have interest rates ranging from 0.974% to 2.625% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2054. In 2024, senior note maturities were $1.9 billion. Additionally, the carrying value of Berkshire parent company non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt declined $1.4 billion in 2024 due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nTEXT: Senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31, 2024, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2023. BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held for lease by our railcar leasing business.

Our annual debt maturities for the next five years are summarized in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also currently expect to pay interest on our debt ranging from $4.7 billion in 2025 to $4.1 billion in 2029 based on borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024. Certain other obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating lease liabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets.

We currently forecast claim payments in 2025 of approximately $38 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2025. However, the timing and amount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events and can be highly uncertain. Actual payments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from forecasted payments. We anticipate that claims payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\nTEXT: Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2024, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF, aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets and purchase commitments of certain materials. We currently estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years will approximate $30 billion, including $12 billion in 2025.\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: Certain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2024 follows.\nTITLE: Property and casualty insurance unpaid losses\nTEXT: We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process.\nTEXT: As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims typically have relatively short claim-tails, while casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims are more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.\nTEXT: Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2024 were approximately $147.6 billion, of which 74% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaid losses of these businesses follows.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

As of December 31, 2024, GEICO’s gross claim liabilities were $24.8 billion and were $23.9 billion, net of reinsurance. GEICO’s claim reserving methodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liability estimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). A combination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.\nTEXT: Claim liability estimates for liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists and personal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case development estimates. As of December 31, 2024, case development liabilities averaged approximately 31% of reported reserves. Case development factors are selected through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.\nTEXT: The adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities is tested using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closure models and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in a given period and projects the ultimate cost.\nTEXT: The aggregate claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2023 were reduced by $550 million during 2024, which produced a corresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2024 reflect the most recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actual frequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.\nTEXT: With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will change by at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31, 2024. A one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities could produce a $220 million increase or decrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forces that would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages to differ in the same direction.\nTEXT: Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group\nTEXT: BHRG’s property and casualty claims arise from a diverse portfolio of reinsurance contracts underwritten across multiple entities through the NICO, General Re and TransRe Groups.

Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple lines of business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we judgmentally allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.\nTEXT: The nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss information received from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms.

However, loss information with respect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary form rather than on an individual claim basis. Loss data includes currently recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently provide reliable IBNR loss estimates.\nTEXT: Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower than primary insurers. Client reporting of claims information is required based on the terms of the contract at intervals ranging from 30 to 180 days after the end of the quarterly or annual period, reporting practices can vary by jurisdiction. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, further delays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays depends on the type of coverage, contractual reporting terms, or the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance coverage.\nTEXT: The premium and loss data BHRG receives is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, so there is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms. Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to audit the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business for compliance with the terms of the policy. Disputes occasionally arise concerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies, which are normally resolved through negotiation. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolution processes. We believe there are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.\nTEXT: Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance requires evaluation of loss information received from our clients. While we generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates, we may perform our own evaluations certain reported case losses and if deemed appropriate, use our own case liability estimate. As of December 31, 2024, our case loss estimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $1.7 billion. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which may cause us to adjust our case estimates.\nTEXT: Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety of actuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of historical data, loss development patterns, industry data and other benchmarks. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handling practices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generally fall into or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\nTEXT: Paid and incurred loss development methods consider the expected case loss emergence and development patterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting loss development analysis include, but are not limited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices, the frequency of client company claim reviews, policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits), loss trends and legal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case loss emergence patterns.\nTEXT: Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods consider actual paid and incurred losses and expected reporting patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimate of the expected unpaid or unreported losses.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

However, our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: Additional analysis – In some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis, determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of an anticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward over time to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgment on the adequacy of the expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revised to include estimates of known major catastrophe events.\nTEXT: Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of the paid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certain property, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Our processes and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patterns of past losses.\nTEXT: For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity of the business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature years reflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.\nTEXT: In 2024, we reduced estimated ultimate pre-2024 accident years’ claim liabilities by $1.7 billion, of which $1.6 billion was attributable to lower-than-expected reported property losses. In 2024, we also reduced estimated ultimate casualty claim liabilities for pre-2024 accident years by approximately $100 million. These reductions produced corresponding increases in pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: The portfolios of contracts within the three BHRG Groups vary considerably, covering multiple lines of business within diverse geographic areas and legal environments, which requires us to vary the application of actuarial methods and weighting of assumptions to determine the appropriate ultimate claims estimates. Given the heterogeneity of the groups of contracts and actuarial methods and assumptions applied, we believe it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in any single or limited group of assumptions to the entire portfolio. Moreover, changes in certain assumptions often create iterative impacts on other actuarial assumptions. Accordingly, we believe it is impracticable to provide meaningful quantification of the impact of changes to any limited number of chosen assumptions.\nTEXT: BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses could be materially higher or lower than the liabilities as of December 31, 2024 due to the inherent uncertainty of determining ultimate claims costs for claims that have occurred or will be deemed to have occurred as of the balance sheet date. We currently believe, however, that significant upward revisions to claims estimates are more likely for casualty claims, given longer claims tails and evolving inflation, legal, judicial and mass tort risks, including the manifestation of new forms of claims that were not contemplated when the policies were written. We believe a five percent increase in BHRG’s casualty claim liabilities over time is reasonably possible, although this should not be viewed as a worst-case scenario given the risks identified. An increase of this magnitude to our gross liabilities for casualty claims at December 31, 2024 could produce an increase in casualty liabilities of $1.75 billion, with a corresponding decrease to pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: Our retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify insurance losses from events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilities associated with these contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures and we expect the claim-tails will be very long. At December 31, 2024, gross unpaid losses were $32.4 billion.\nTEXT: Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnification and, as such, we currently expect that the aggregate remaining losses payable under our policies will not exceed $47 billion. While ultimate claims will be affected by judicial and legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or mass tort exposures, we currently believe it unlikely that losses will increase to the maximum or decline by more than 15% of our estimated gross claims liability as of December 31, 2024.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\n"

We apply judgmental probability factors to these scenarios to determine an expected outcome. We also monitor subsequent loss payment activity and ceding company reports and other available information. We re-estimate ultimate losses when significant events or significant deviations from expectations are revealed.\nTEXT: Certain of our contracts include asbestos and environmental, as well as other mass tort exposures. Our estimated liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024. Ceding companies do not consistently provide reliable and detailed underlying claims data, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct detailed analyses of the underlying loss data in making an estimate of ultimate remaining claims liabilities. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we may apply recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation and judicial rulings could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.\nTEXT: Deferred charges for retroactive reinsurance contracts, which at the inception dates of the contracts, represent the excess of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. Deferred charges are subsequently adjusted based on the changes to expected ultimate liabilities and the timing of actual and expected future loss payments. Deferred charge assets were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024. We estimate that deferred charge assets will decline $830 million in 2025, producing a corresponding charge to pre-tax earnings.\nTEXT: Overall, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities for prior year retroactive reinsurance contracts by $196 million in 2024, primarily for asbestos, environmental and other casualty exposures. This increase, net of the related changes in deferred charge assets had an insignificant impact on underwriting results.\nTITLE: Other Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: Our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2024 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $83.9 billion and indefinite-lived other intangible assets of $18.9 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more likely than not there has been an impairment.\nTEXT: Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and of indefinite-lived intangible assets. Several methods may be used to estimate fair values, including market quotations, multiples of earnings and other valuation techniques, such as discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods. The key assumptions and inputs used in fair value determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs.\nTEXT: Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. Reasonable estimates of the fair value of a business enterprise may range widely.\nTEXT: If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\nTEXT: As of December 31, 2024, we concluded that more-likely-than not, the goodwill recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet was not impaired. However, the fair value estimates of the reporting units and assets are subject to change based on market and economic conditions, as well as events affecting our businesses or the industries in which they operate, which we cannot reliably predict. It is reasonably possible that adverse changes in such conditions or events could result in the recognition of impairment losses in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTITLE: Management’s Discussion and Analysis\nTITLE: Critical Accounting Estimates\nTITLE: Other Critical Accounting Estimates\nTEXT: In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2024, our estimated fair values of seven reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. These reporting units included PCC, as well as three reporting units acquired in late 2022 and early 2023. Our estimated fair value of PCC’s equity exceeded the carrying value of $28.5 billion, which included goodwill of approximately $7.5 billion, by nearly 20%. Of the three units acquired in 2022 and 2023, the largest was Pilot, which had an estimated fair value of approximately $20.3 billion and a carrying value of $18.3 billion, including goodwill of $6.5 billion. The remaining five other reporting units had an aggregate estimated fair value of approximately $11.7 billion, which exceeded our aggregate carrying value by approximately 12%. The carrying value of these units included goodwill of approximately $4.6 billion.\n"

Our strategy is to acquire or originate such instruments at prices or with interest rates considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operations and for general purposes. We attempt to maintain high credit ratings to minimize the cost of our debt. We generally do not utilize derivative products, such as interest rate swaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.\nTEXT: The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables and notes payable and other borrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the perceived credit risk, prepayment options, liquidity and other factors, as well as general market conditions.\nTEXT: The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assets and liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk. We assumed that the interest rate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes to other factors used to determine the value of the instrument.

(“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in numerous diverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy, manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and its consolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 26. Information concerning significant business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with the accounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statement date. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidate variable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant to the VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain balances in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for 2023 have been reclassified to conform to current year presentations. We reclassified the asset, liability, revenue and expense balances in 2023 associated with Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”) from the Railroad, Utilities and Energy sections of the Balance Sheet, Statement of Earnings and Statement of Cash Flows to the Insurance and Other sections of those statements. We also reclassified the balances within the affected Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These reclassifications conform presentations for comparability to presentations in 2024. These reclassifications had no effect on consolidated total assets, liabilities, shareholders’ equity, revenues, expenses, or on net earnings or cash flows from the amounts previously reported. See Note 1(y) for a summary of the reclassifications. We continue to believe that reporting the railroad, utilities and energy subsidiaries separately in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Earnings is appropriate, given relative significance of property, plant and equipment, capital expenditures and debt. Further, these subsidiaries are not supported by Berkshire debt guarantees or other financial commitments. (b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements We prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the period. Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty insurance claims are subject to considerable estimation error due to the inherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with determinations of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, fair values of certain financial instruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerable judgment. Additionally, significant estimates may be required in the evaluation of certain other long-lived assets for impairments and the recognition of expected credit losses on amounts owed to us. Estimates may be subject to significant adjustments in future periods due to ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical events, as well as changes in industry or company-specific factors or events. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements. (c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills Cash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills have maturities exceeding three months and less than one year at the time of purchase.\nTITLE: (1)Significant accounting policies and practices\n"

Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold the securities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value. Our investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale. We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings using the interest method. We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in earnings when the securities are sold. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in earnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance sheet date, we evaluate unrealized losses, considering the severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance for credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the present value of estimated expected cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be subsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss that is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. (e)Investments in equity securities We carry investments in equity securities at fair value and record the changes in fair values in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains and losses. (f)Investments under the equity method We utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant influence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This presumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments when such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock, and do not apply the equity method to investments that are not in-substance common stock as defined by GAAP. In applying the equity method, we increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive income of the investee. We record additional investments at cost and equity distributions received as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments in the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. (g)Loans and finance receivables Loans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans and site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances for expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loan origination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are capitalized and accrued to investment income as yield adjustments over the lives of the loans. Measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the net present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of expected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality indicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral recovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the historical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors.

We place loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans are first applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrual once a loan is less than 90 days delinquent. Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process of foreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification is complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when the collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstances concerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan. (h)Other receivables Other receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance losses recoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premiums receivables and other receivables are primarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination. Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatory government-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables arise from unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses on property and casualty claims and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables are stated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. We measure expected credit losses primarily utilizing credit loss history. In addition, our credit loss estimates consider current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review the credit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other forms of credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge off receivables against the allowances after reasonable collection efforts are exhausted. (i)Derivatives We carry assets and liabilities arising from derivative contracts at fair value in other assets and accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Balances are net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record the changes in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposes in earnings or if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities when inclusion in regulated rates is probable. (j)Fair value measurements Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principal market exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderly markets when estimating fair value. In such circumstances, alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate to determine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange and not acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities. Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.

We also own equipment that we lease to others under lease contracts. We record additions, improvements and betterments to such properties at cost. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services as well as certain indirect costs, including interest over the construction period, are capitalized. With respect to constructed assets that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 years and locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 45 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique to our utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems – 5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to 50 years.We depreciate property, plant and equipment used in operations by our other businesses to the estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated service lives. Ranges of estimated service lives of depreciable assets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery and equipment – 3 to 30 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 4 to 15 years. We depreciate the equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when the revenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We evaluate property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset and the residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings, except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts of regulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value. (m)Leases We are party to contracts where we lease property from others. When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments that depend on an index or rate. The lease term is considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain lease contracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide variable payments based on performance or usage. Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that options will be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets are subject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, for some leases we do not separate lease components from non-lease components by class of asset and we do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.\nTITLE: (1)Significant accounting policies and practices\n"

With respect to constructed assets that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulated operations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost of equity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and other costs that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation expense of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciation methods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under group depreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences in the service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold, no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.

The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading which create a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for each performance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destination pair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs, interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount to transport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as the service is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenues recognized represent the portion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freight transportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recorded as a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments. Utilities and energy revenues derive primarily from regulated electricity and natural gas sales. Regulated electricity and natural gas revenues are primarily tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatory commissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gas and have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time as energy is delivered or services are provided. Such revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directly with the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for regulated energy products and services are established by regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price among the separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to final approval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimated refunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations are satisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in time when the services are completed. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, construction management and consulting, automotive repair, aircraft management, aviation training, franchising activities and news distribution.Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable under the terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases. (p)Losses and loss adjustment expenses We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities represent the undiscounted estimated ultimate payment amounts. We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and (3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings are stated net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable ceded under reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnify policyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts. (q)Retroactive reinsurance contracts We record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short-duration retroactive reinsurance contracts consistent with property and casualty contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect to retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representing the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently adjust deferred charge assets as of the balance sheet date based on changes in the estimated timing and amount of ultimate loss payments, with retrospective application to the inception of the contract using the interest method.

We capitalize the direct incremental costs that relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject to ultimate recoverability. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associated with successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. For short-duration property and casualty insurance contracts, deferred policy acquisition costs are reflected in expenses over the contract term as the related premiums are earned. For long-duration life contracts, we expense deferred policy acquisition costs at a constant level based on the expected amount of insurance in-force and the expected term of the contract using the assumptions consistent with those used in determining related insurance liabilities. (s)Life, annuity and health insurance benefits Liabilities for life, annuity and health insurance benefits under long-duration insurance contracts represent the present value of expected future cash outflows from future benefit payments and certain non-acquisition costs, less the present value of expected future “net premiums,” which is the portion of gross premiums required to provide for all expected future benefits and variable expenses. Periodic payment and annuity reinsurance contracts are regarded as limited payment contracts. Such liabilities include the present value of expected future payments based on the discount rates used to measure benefit liabilities and deferred profit liabilities, which are based on the excess of gross premiums received over the net premiums established at the inception of the contract. In estimating future cash flows, we consider the timing and amount of future claims, premiums and expenses, which require estimates of expected mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. Cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually, with the effects of assumption changes recorded in earnings. The discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are revised each reporting period based on the prevailing upper-medium-grade corporate bond yields (generally single-A rated credit ratings) that reflect the duration and currency attributes of the liabilities. In measuring benefit liabilities, we generally group contracts by contract issue year. The effects of changes in discount rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.(t)Regulated utilities and energy businesses Certain regulated utility and energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs from customers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process. Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities. Regulatory assets and liabilities are subsequently amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods. Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates by considering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by other regulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable of inclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) or returned to customers. (u)Foreign currency The accounts of certain subsidiaries are measured using functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate as of the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries are included in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.\nTEXT: On January 31, 2023, we acquired an additional 41.4% interest in Pilot Travel Centers, LLC (“Pilot”) for approximately $8.2 billion. The acquisition increased our interest to 80%, representing a controlling interest in Pilot for financial reporting purposes as of that date. Accordingly, we began consolidating Pilot’s financial statements in our Consolidated Financial Statements on February 1, 2023. Prior to that date, we accounted for our 38.6% interest in Pilot under the equity method.\nTEXT: Pilot operates travel centers and fuel-only retail locations across the U.S. and in five Canadian provinces, primarily under the names Pilot or Flying J, as well as large wholesale fuel and fuel marketing businesses in the U.S. Pilot also sells diesel fuel at other locations in the U.S. and Canada through various arrangements with third party travel centers and operates a water disposal business in the oil fields sector.\nTEXT: In applying the acquisition method of accounting, we remeasured our previously held 38.6% investment in Pilot to fair value as of the acquisition date. We recognized a one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain of approximately $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2023, representing the excess of the fair value of that interest over the carrying value under the equity method.\nTEXT: In January 2024, we acquired the remaining noncontrolling interests in Pilot for $2.6 billion, increasing our ownership of Pilot to 100%. The acquisition of a noncontrolling interest represents an equity transaction and we recorded an increase of $517 million to capital in excess of par value for the excess of the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest acquired over the consideration paid, net of deferred income tax liabilities arising from the transaction.\nTEXT: A summary of the values of Pilot’s assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests as of January 31, 2023 follows (in millions).

We have also agreed to passivity commitments as requested by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which collectively, in our judgment, restrict our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of American Express. Accordingly, we do not use the equity method with respect to our investment in American Express common stock and we continue to record our investment at fair value.\nTEXT: (5)Equity method investments Berkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equity method.

As of December 31, 2024, the excess of our carrying value over the fair value of each of these investments based on their respective market prices was approximately 25% of the carrying value. We evaluated these investments for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2024. For each investment, we considered our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value exceeds carrying value, the magnitude and duration of the decline in fair value, the operating results of the company, as well as other factors. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances, we concluded the recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of our investments in Kraft Heinz and Berkadia approximated our share of shareowners’ equity of each of these entities. The carrying value of our investment in Occidental common stock exceeded our share of its shareholders’ equity as of September 30, 2024 by approximately $9.9 billion. Based upon the limited information available to us, we concluded the excess represents goodwill. As described in Note 2, we ceased accounting for Pilot under the equity method as of February 1, 2023.

Investments in fixed maturity and equity securities and short-term investments on deposit with U.S. state insurance authorities in accordance with state insurance regulations were approximately $5.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: Combined shareholders’ equity of U.S.-based insurance subsidiaries determined pursuant to statutory accounting rules (Surplus as Regards Policyholders) was approximately $310 billion at December 31, 2024 and $303 billion at December 31, 2023. Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP due to differences in accounting for certain assets and liabilities. For instance, the recognition of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance, life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gains on certain investments and deferred income taxes under GAAP differs from recognition under U.S. statutory reporting. In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurance subsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.\nTEXT: (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses Reconciliations of the changes in unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”), excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts (see Note 17), for each of the three years ended December 31, 2024 follow (in millions).

These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 2.2% in 2024, 3.5% in 2023 and 3.2% in 2022.Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our primary insurance businesses declined $602 million in 2024, $2.1 billion in 2023 and $1.1 billion in 2022. The decline in estimated liabilities in 2024 reflected lower-than-expected private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property losses, partially offset by increased casualty losses. The estimated liability reductions in 2023 and 2022 were primarily from private passenger auto, medical professional liability and property coverages. Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of our reinsurance businesses were reduced $1.7 billion in 2024, $1.4 billion in 2023 and $1.6 billion in 2022. The reductions in 2024 and 2023 were primarily attributable to lower-than-expected property losses, while the reductions in 2022 were attributable to both property and casualty losses. Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental and asbestos exposures, excluding liabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $1.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2023.

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methods and techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceived changes in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates. Average liabilities are based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claims prior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimates and for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that are quickly settled. Case loss estimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, are based on the facts and merits of the claim. Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than for physical damage coverages, primarily due to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the case estimate is first established. Consequently, additional case development liabilities are established, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities. For unreported claims, IBNR claim liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage based on historical data, from which reported claims are deducted to produce the estimated number of unreported claims. The product of the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We may record supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.\nTITLE: (16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n"

We believe that analysis of losses incurred and paid by the accident year of the underlying event is irrelevant given that our exposure to losses incepted when the contract incepted. We also believe that the classification of reported claims and case development liabilities has little or no practical analytical value. Substantially all of the losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and paid related to contracts written in prior years.\nTEXT: Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred include changes in estimated ultimate liabilities and related adjustments to deferred charge assets arising from the changes in the estimated timing and amount of loss payments. In 2023, we increased estimated ultimate liabilities under certain contracts by $1.1 billion, primarily attributable to revised estimates for asbestos, environmental and other casualty claims. Including the adjustments to related deferred charge assets, the increase in ultimate liabilities produced a net expense of approximately $650 million in 2023. Deferred charge assets on retroactive reinsurance contracts were $8.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and $9.5 billion at December 31, 2023.\nTEXT: In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project losses under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tails for many contracts to be very long, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports and other information concerning the underlying losses. We revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimate losses periodically or when significant events occur.\nTEXT: We monitor evolving case law and its effect on asbestos, environmental and other mass tort claims. Changing laws or government regulations, as well as newly identified toxins and injury events, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, new contract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results of operations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonably possible. Our estimates of ultimate liabilities for asbestos and environmental exposures under our contracts were approximately $11.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and $12.2 billion at December 31, 2023.\nTITLE: (18)Long-duration insurance contracts\nTITLE: Long-duration insurance contracts\nTEXT: A summary of our long-duration life, annuity and health insurance benefits liabilities disaggregated by our two principal product categories, periodic payment annuity (“annuities”) and life and health insurance, follows (in millions).

It is reasonably possible that certain of these income tax examinations will be settled in 2025. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, net unrecognized tax benefits were $501 million and $480 million, respectively. Included in the balance at December 31, 2024, were $448 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. We do not expect material increases to the estimated amount of unrecognized tax benefits during 2025. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a new global minimum tax of 15% intended to be effective on January 1, 2024. While the U.S. has not yet adopted Pillar Two rules, various other governments around the world are enacting legislation to adopt the rules. As currently designed, Pillar Two would apply to our worldwide operations. We do not currently have material operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the Pillar Two minimum tax rate, and we do not currently expect these rules will materially increase our global tax costs. There remains uncertainty as to the final Pillar Two model rules.\nTITLE: (20)Income taxes\n"

The hierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below. Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets. Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets or liabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves for instruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments of the issuer or entities in the same industry sector. Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management is required to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in the assets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs require management to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by market participants in valuing assets or liabilities.

The tabular information that follows shows data of Berkshire’s business segments reconciled to amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Intersegment transactions are not eliminated from segment results when those transactions are considered in assessing the results of the respective segments and are not considered to be material. Furthermore, investment gains and losses, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments and amortization of certain acquisition accounting adjustments or certain other corporate income and expense items are not considered in assessing the financial performance of operating businesses. Collectively, these items are included in corporate, eliminations and other to reconcile segment totals to consolidated amounts.

Given the number and diversity of Berkshire’s operating segments and the differences in revenue streams and cost structures, there are wide variances in the form, content and levels of such expense information significant to the business. Expenses considered significant for one operating segment may not be significant in others. With respect to insurance underwriting, the chief operating decision maker considers pre-tax underwriting earnings to allocate resources and capital, together with perceived risks and opportunities in the insurance markets that affect rates and risks of loss. Typically, there are no budgeted or forecasted premiums or underwriting results. For most non-insurance businesses, pre-tax earnings are considered in allocating resources and capital, although income taxes are also considered at BHE, given the magnitude of production tax credits associated with wind-powered electricity generation investments and the related impacts from regulation.

Third-party reports indicate that the 2022 Wildfire resulted in 11 structures damaged, 185 structures destroyed, 12 injuries and four fatalities. The U.S. Forest Service issued a Wildland Fire Origin and Cause Supplemental Incident Report. The report concluded that a tree coming in contact with a power line is the probable cause of the 2022 Wildfire. The 2020 Wildfires and 2022 Wildfire, together, are referred to as the “Wildfires.” As of the date of this filing, a significant number of complaints and demands alleging similar claims related to the Wildfires have been filed in Oregon and California, including a class action complaint in Oregon associated with the 2020 Wildfires for which certain jury verdicts were issued as described below. The plaintiffs seek damages for economic losses, noneconomic losses, including mental suffering, emotional distress, personal injury and loss of life, as well as punitive damages, other damages and attorneys’ fees. Several insurance carriers have filed subrogation complaints in Oregon and California with allegations similar to those made in the aforementioned complaints. Additionally, PacifiCorp received correspondence from the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice regarding the potential recovery of certain costs and damages alleged to have occurred on federal and state lands in connection with certain of the Oregon 2020 Wildfires. In December 2024, the United States of America filed a complaint against PacifiCorp in conjunction with the correspondence from the U.S. Department of Justice. The civil cover sheet accompanying the complaint demands damages estimated to exceed $900 million. PacifiCorp is actively cooperating with the U.S. and Oregon Departments of Justice on resolving these alleged claims.Amounts sought in outstanding complaints and demands filed in Oregon and in certain demands in California approximate $3 billion, excluding any doubling or trebling of damages included in the complaints and the mass complaints described below that seek $48 billion. Generally, the complaints filed in California do not specify damages sought and are excluded from this amount.Based on available information to date, we believe it is probable that losses will be incurred associated with the Wildfires. Final determinations of liability will only be made following the completion of comprehensive investigations, litigation and similar processes. On September 30, 2020, a class action complaint against PacifiCorp was filed captioned Jeanyne James et al. v. PacifiCorp et al. (the “James case”), in Oregon Circuit Court in Multnomah County, Oregon (the “Multnomah Court”) in connection with the 2020 Wildfires. In April 2023, a jury trial for the James case with respect to 17 named plaintiffs began in Multnomah Court. In June 2023, the jury issued its verdict finding PacifiCorp liable to the 17 named plaintiffs and to the class with respect to four wildfires. The jury found PacifiCorp’s conduct grossly negligent, reckless and willful as to each plaintiff and the entire class. The jury awarded the 17 named plaintiffs $90 million of damages, including $4 million of economic damages, $68 million of noneconomic damages and $18 million of punitive damages based on a 0.25 multiplier of the economic and noneconomic damages. In September 2023, the Multnomah Court ordered trial dates for three damages phase trials for the James case, wherein plaintiffs in each of the three damages phase trials would present evidence regarding their damages. In January 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award for the June 2023 James case verdict of $92 million based on the amounts awarded by the jury, as well as doubling of the economic damages and offsetting of insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs. In January 2024, PacifiCorp filed a notice of appeal associated with the June 2023 verdict in the James case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action, and filed a motion to stay further damages phase trials. On February 14, 2024, the Oregon Court of Appeals denied PacifiCorp’s request to stay the damages phase trials. On February 13, 2024, the 17 named plaintiffs filed a notice of cross-appeal as to the January 2024 limited judgment and money award. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. In January 2024, the jury for the first James case damages phase trial awarded nine plaintiffs $62 million of damages, including $6 million of economic damages and $56 million of noneconomic damages. Subsequently, the Multnomah Court increased the economic damages by $6 million and added $16 million of punitive damages, bringing the aggregate damages awarded to $84 million. In March 2024, the Multnomah Court granted in large part PacifiCorp’s request to offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the nine plaintiffs. In April 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award of $80 million for the January 2024 James verdict, based on the aggregate damages awarded, offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs.\nTITLE: (27)Contingencies and commitments\n"

In May 2024, the Multnomah Court granted PacifiCorp’s request to offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the ten plaintiffs. In June 2024, the Multnomah Court entered a limited judgment and money award of $38 million for the March 2024 James verdict, based on the aggregate amounts awarded, offset by insurance proceeds received by plaintiffs.The January, April and June 2024 limited judgments created liens against PacifiCorp, attaching a debt for the money awards. In each instance, PacifiCorp posted a supersedeas bond, which stays any effort to seek payment of the judgment pending final resolution of any appeals. Under ORS 82.010, interest at a rate of 9% per annum will accrue on the judgment commencing at the date the judgment was entered until the entire money award is paid, amended or reversed by an appellate court. PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict and further amended its appeal of the June 2023 verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. PacifiCorp’s opening brief is due to be filed with the Oregon Court of Appeals on or before February 25, 2025, in connection with its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict and the January and March 2024 verdicts for the first two James damages phase trials. In February 2025, the jury for the third James case damages phase trial awarded seven plaintiffs $32 million of noneconomic damages in addition to $4 million of economic damages stipulated for eight plaintiffs prior to the trial. In accordance with Oregon law, plaintiffs asked the court to double the economic damages to $8 million after the verdict. PacifiCorp expects the court will award the doubling of economic damages and also increase the award for $9 million in punitive damages by applying the 0.25 multiplier of economic and noneconomic damages consistent with the June 2023 James verdict. As a result, PacifiCorp expects the total award for the eight plaintiffs to be approximately $49 million. PacifiCorp filed post-trial motions with the Multnomah Court requesting the court offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the eight plaintiffs. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s damage awards associated with the February 2025 jury verdict once judgment is entered.In March 2024, settlement was reached with five commercial timber plaintiffs in the James case, and the jury trial scheduled for April 2024 was cancelled.Between April 2024 and January 2025, six separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming 1,591 individual class members were filed in the Multnomah Court referencing the James case as the lead case. Complaints for five of the plaintiffs in the mass complaints were subsequently dismissed. These James case mass complaints make damages-only allegations seeking economic, noneconomic and punitive damages, as well as doubling of economic damages. In December 2024, two additional complaints were filed in Multnomah Court on behalf of eight plaintiffs also referencing the James case as the lead case. PacifiCorp believes the magnitude of damages sought by the class members in the James case mass complaints and additional two complaints to be of remote likelihood of being awarded based on the amounts awarded in the jury verdicts described above that are being appealed.In October 2024, the Multnomah Court issued a case management order, which sets forth nine additional damages phase trials with up to ten plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to occur throughout 2025, with the verdict for the first trial received in February 2025, as described above.A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate. Estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires were based on the information available to the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case. Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time, and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available. Through December 31, 2024, PacifiCorp recorded cumulative estimated probable Wildfire losses, before taxes and expected related insurance recoveries, of approximately $2.75 billion. Wildfire loss accruals were $346 million in 2024, $1.9 billion in 2023 and $225 million in 2022. Insurance recoveries recorded to date in connection with the Wildfires were $530 million, including $253 million in 2023 and $161 million in 2022. No further insurance recoveries are expected to become available. Cumulative Wildfire loss payments through December 31, 2024 were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $533 million was paid in 2024. Estimated unpaid liabilities for the Wildfires were approximately $1.54 billion at December 31, 2024.\nTITLE: (27)Contingencies and commitments\n"

PacifiCorp amended its January 2024 appeal of the June 2023 James verdict to include the January 2024 jury verdict and further amended its appeal of the June 2023 verdict to include the March 2024 jury verdict. PacifiCorp’s opening brief is due to be filed with the Oregon Court of Appeals on or before February 25, 2025, in connection with its appeal of the June 2023 James verdict and the January and March 2024 verdicts for the first two James damages phase trials.\nTEXT: In February 2025, the jury for the third James case damages phase trial awarded seven plaintiffs $32 million of noneconomic damages in addition to $4 million of economic damages stipulated for eight plaintiffs prior to the trial. In accordance with Oregon law, plaintiffs asked the court to double the economic damages to $8 million after the verdict. PacifiCorp expects the court will award the doubling of economic damages and also increase the award for $9 million in punitive damages by applying the 0.25 multiplier of economic and noneconomic damages consistent with the June 2023 James verdict. As a result, PacifiCorp expects the total award for the eight plaintiffs to be approximately $49 million. PacifiCorp filed post-trial motions with the Multnomah Court requesting the court offset the damage awards by deducting insurance proceeds received by any of the eight plaintiffs. PacifiCorp intends to appeal the jury’s damage awards associated with the February 2025 jury verdict once judgment is entered.\nTEXT: In March 2024, settlement was reached with five commercial timber plaintiffs in the James case, and the jury trial scheduled for April 2024 was cancelled.\nTEXT: Between April 2024 and January 2025, six separate mass complaints against PacifiCorp naming 1,591 individual class members were filed in the Multnomah Court referencing the James case as the lead case. Complaints for five of the plaintiffs in the mass complaints were subsequently dismissed. These James case mass complaints make damages-only allegations seeking economic, noneconomic and punitive damages, as well as doubling of economic damages. In December 2024, two additional complaints were filed in Multnomah Court on behalf of eight plaintiffs also referencing the James case as the lead case. PacifiCorp believes the magnitude of damages sought by the class members in the James case mass complaints and additional two complaints to be of remote likelihood of being awarded based on the amounts awarded in the jury verdicts described above that are being appealed.\nTEXT: In October 2024, the Multnomah Court issued a case management order, which sets forth nine additional damages phase trials with up to ten plaintiffs per trial. The trials are scheduled to occur throughout 2025, with the verdict for the first trial received in February 2025, as described above.\nTEXT: A provision for a loss contingency is recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. PacifiCorp evaluates the related range of reasonably estimated losses and records a loss based on its best estimate within that range or the lower end of the range if there is no better estimate.\nTEXT: Estimated probable losses associated with the Wildfires were based on the information available to the date of this filing, including (i) ongoing cause and origin investigations; (ii) ongoing settlement and mediation discussions; (iii) other litigation matters and upcoming legal proceedings; and (iv) the status of the James case. Wildfire estimated losses include estimates for fire suppression costs, real and personal property damages, natural resource damages and noneconomic damages such as personal injury damages and loss of life damages that are considered probable of being incurred and that it is able to reasonably estimate at this time, and which is subject to change as additional relevant information becomes available.\nTEXT: Through December 31, 2024, PacifiCorp recorded cumulative estimated probable Wildfire losses, before taxes and expected related insurance recoveries, of approximately $2.75 billion. Wildfire loss accruals were $346 million in 2024, $1.9 billion in 2023 and $225 million in 2022. Insurance recoveries recorded to date in connection with the Wildfires were $530 million, including $253 million in 2023 and $161 million in 2022. No further insurance recoveries are expected to become available. Cumulative Wildfire loss payments through December 31, 2024 were approximately $1.2 billion, of which $533 million was paid in 2024. Estimated unpaid liabilities for the Wildfires were approximately $1.54 billion at December 31, 2024.\n"

In each case, plaintiffs claim HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries (and in one case BHE) conspired with co-defendants to artificially inflate real estate commissions by following and enforcing multiple listing service (“MLS”) rules that require listing agents to offer a commission split to cooperating agents in order for the property to appear on the MLS (“Cooperative Compensation Rule”). None of the complaints specify damages sought. However, two cases also allege Texas state law deceptive trade practices claims, for which plaintiffs have asserted damages totaling approximately $9 billion by separate written notice as required by Texas law. In one of these cases, Burnett (formerly Sitzer) et al. v. HomeServices of America, Inc. et al. (the “Burnett case”), a jury trial in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri commenced on October 16, 2023, and the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs on October 31, 2023, finding that the named defendants participated in a conspiracy to follow and enforce the Cooperative Compensation Rule, which conspiracy had the purpose or effect of raising, inflating, or stabilizing broker commission rates paid by home sellers. The jury further found that the class plaintiffs had proved damages in the amount of $1.8 billion. Joint and several liability applies for the co-defendants. Federal law authorizes trebling of damages and the award of pre-judgment interest and attorney fees. To date, all co-defendants have reached settlements with the plaintiffs. The U.S District Court approved certain of these settlements in May 2024, which has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In April 2024, HomeServices agreed to terms with the plaintiffs to settle all claims asserted against HomeServices and certain of its subsidiaries in the Burnett case to effectuate a nationwide class settlement. The final settlement agreement includes scheduled payments over the next four years aggregating $250 million. HomeServices received final court approval on November 27, 2024, which has been appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. If the settlement is not affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, HomeServices intends to vigorously appeal on multiple grounds the jury’s findings and damage award in the Burnett case, including whether the case can proceed as a class action. The appeals process and further actions could take several years. Other legal matters In September 2024, National Indemnity Company (“NICO”) recorded a pre-tax charge of $490 million in connection with a settlement agreement reached concerning certain non-insurance affiliates that filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of bankruptcy code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the “Court”) in 2023. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, NICO has agreed to pay $535 million to the bankruptcy estate in consideration of a release of all estate causes of action against NICO and its affiliates. The settlement agreement, which is opposed by certain creditors, is subject to approval by the Court. NICO also accrued a recoverable of $45 million from a third party that is covered under the release, which was received in the fourth quarter. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We currently believe that liabilities that may arise as a result of such other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. CommitmentsOur subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business to purchase goods and services in the future, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significant of our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses, our shared aircraft ownership and leasing business and certain materials purchase commitments. As of December 31, 2024, estimated future payments under those arrangements over the next five years were as follows: $12 billion in 2025, $6 billion in 2026, $5 billion in 2027, $4 billion in 2028, $3 billion in 2029, and thereafter $28 billion.\nTITLE: (27)Contingencies and commitments\n"
