The calculation of tangible book value per common share represents tangible common equity divided by common shares outstanding.The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this document are set forth in the following tables.Reconciliations from U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Consolidated Financial Measures Three Months EndedSeptember 30,Nine Months EndedSeptember 30,$ in millions2025202420252024Net revenues$18,224 $15,383 $52,755 $45,538 Adjustment for mark-to-market losses (gains) on DCP1(248)(239)(476)(372)Adjusted Net revenues—non-GAAP$17,976 $15,144 $52,279 $45,166 Compensation expense$7,442 $6,733 $22,153 $19,889 Adjustment for mark-to-market gains (losses) on DCP1(300)(276)(669)(580)Adjusted Compensation expense—non-GAAP$7,142 $6,457 $21,484 $19,309 Wealth Management Net revenues$8,234 $7,270 $23,325 $20,942 Adjustment for mark-to-market losses (gains) on DCP1(206)(170)(369)(265)Adjusted Wealth Management Net revenues—non-GAAP$8,028 $7,100 $22,956 $20,677 Wealth Management Compensation expense$4,388 $3,868 $12,534 $11,257 Adjustment for mark-to-market gains (losses) on DCP1(222)(184)(469)(373)Adjusted Wealth Management Compensation expense—non-GAAP$4,166 $3,684 $12,065 $10,884 1.Net revenues and compensation expense are adjusted for DCP for both Firm and Wealth Management business segment.$ in millionsAtSeptember 30,2025AtDecember 31,2024 Tangible equityCommon equity$100,212 $94,761 Less: Goodwill and net intangible assets(22,820)(23,157)Tangible common equity—non-GAAP$77,392 $71,604\nTEXT: Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe analysts, investors and other stakeholders consider useful to allow for comparability to peers and of the period-to-period use of our equity.

These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.Provision for Credit LossesThe Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $1 million in the current quarter, primarily related to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $11 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate loans, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook.The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $71 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending and residential real estate portfolios, as well as portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $25 million was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate and securities-based loans, and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook. Non-Interest ExpensesNon-interest expenses of $5,736 million in the current quarter increased 10%, compared with the prior year quarter, primarily as a result of higher Compensation and benefits expenses.•Compensation and benefits expenses increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the formulaic payout to Wealth Management advisors driven by higher compensable revenue and higher expenses related to DCP. •Non-compensation expenses increased, primarily as a result of higher marketing and business development costs and increased technology spend, partially offset by lower amortization of intangible assets.Non-interest expenses of $16,604 million in the current year period increased 9%, compared with the prior year period,\n"

These factors, along with other developments, such as pricing changes to certain deposit types due to various competitive dynamics, have impacted our net interest income. To the extent they persist, or other factors arise, such as central bank actions, net interest income may be impacted in future periods.Provision for Credit LossesThe Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments was a net release of $1 million in the current quarter, primarily related to improvements in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $11 million in the prior year quarter was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate loans, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook.The Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $71 million in the current year period was primarily related to certain specific loans in our tailored lending and residential real estate portfolios, as well as portfolio growth in residential real estate loans. In the prior year period, the Provision for credit losses on loans and lending commitments of $25 million was primarily related to certain specific commercial real estate and securities-based loans, and portfolio growth, partially offset by improvements in the macroeconomic outlook.

Accounting updates not referenced below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates:•Derivatives Scope Refinements and Share-Based Consideration from a Customer. This update introduces targeted refinements to the derivatives and revenue recognition accounting guidance. It expands an existing scope exception for derivative accounting to exclude certain non-exchange-traded contracts. The update also clarifies that share-based payments from a customer are treated as noncash consideration under the revenue recognition standard until the related performance obligations are fulfilled and the right to the consideration is unconditional. The update is effective beginning January 1, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Transition may be applied prospectively, or under a modified retrospective approach.•Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal - Use Software. This update introduces targeted improvements to the recognition and capitalization guidance for internal-use software costs. The update eliminates the prior “project stage” framework and instead requires capitalization of software development costs when (i) management has authorized and committed to funding the software project, and (ii) it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform its intended function. In assessing the probability threshold, entities are required to evaluate whether significant development uncertainty exists, including whether the software contains novel or unproven functionality or whether significant performance requirements have not been identified or continue to be substantially revised. The update is effective beginning January 1, 2028, with early adoption permitted. Transition may be applied prospectively, retrospectively, or under a modified approach.We continue to evaluate accounting updates disclosed in the “Accounting Development Updates” section of the 2024 Form 10-K, including the implementation of the Income Tax Disclosures accounting update effective for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2025. We do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further discussion about our critical accounting policies, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates” in the 2024 Form 10-K.\n"

Accounting updates not referenced below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or to not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.\nTEXT: We are currently evaluating the following accounting updates:•Derivatives Scope Refinements and Share-Based Consideration from a Customer. This update introduces targeted refinements to the derivatives and revenue recognition accounting guidance. It expands an existing scope exception for derivative accounting to exclude certain non-exchange-traded contracts. The update also clarifies that share-based payments from a customer are treated as noncash consideration under the revenue recognition standard until the related performance obligations are fulfilled and the right to the consideration is unconditional. The update is effective beginning January 1, 2027, with early adoption permitted. Transition may be applied prospectively, or under a modified retrospective approach.•Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal - Use Software. This update introduces targeted improvements to the recognition and capitalization guidance for internal-use software costs. The update eliminates the prior “project stage” framework and instead requires capitalization of software development costs when (i) management has authorized and committed to funding the software project, and (ii) it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform its intended function. In assessing the probability threshold, entities are required to evaluate whether significant development uncertainty exists, including whether the software contains novel or unproven functionality or whether significant performance requirements have not been identified or continue to be substantially revised. The update is effective beginning January 1, 2028, with early adoption permitted. Transition may be applied prospectively, retrospectively, or under a modified approach.We continue to evaluate accounting updates disclosed in the “Accounting Development Updates” section of the 2024 Form 10-K, including the implementation of the Income Tax Disclosures accounting update effective for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2025. We do not expect a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations upon adoption.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial statements), the fair value of financial instruments, goodwill and intangible assets, legal and regulatory contingencies (see Note 14 to the financial statements in the 2024 Form 10-K and Note 13 to the financial statements) and income taxes policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.

Regulatory Liquidity FrameworkLiquidity Coverage Ratio and Net Stable Funding RatioWe and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum LCR and NSFR of 100%. The LCR rule requires large banking organizations to have sufficient Eligible HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. In determining Eligible HQLA for LCR purposes, weightings (or asset haircuts) are applied to HQLA, and certain HQLA held in subsidiaries is excluded. The NSFR rule requires large banking organizations to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is their regulatory capital and liabilities subject to standardized weightings, equal to or greater than their required stable funding, which is their projected minimum funding needs, over a one-year time horizon. As of September 30, 2025, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum LCR and NSFR requirements of 100%.Liquidity Coverage RatioAverage Daily BalanceThree Months Ended$ in millionsSeptember 30,2025June 30,2025Eligible HQLACash deposits with central banks$51,867 $52,122 Securities1234,905 241,114 Total Eligible HQLA$286,772 $293,236 Net cash outflows$222,223 $218,347 LCR129 %134 %1.Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.Funding ManagementWe manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification of secured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured and unsecured financing. We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings, bank notes, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting global investors and currencies. Treasury allocates interest expense to our businesses based on the tenor and interest rate profile of the assets being funded. Treasury similarly allocates interest income to businesses carrying deposit products and other liabilities across the businesses based on the characteristics of those deposits and other liabilities.Secured FinancingFor a discussion of our secured financing activities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Management—Secured Financing” in the 2024 Form 10-K.\n"

In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities.For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements.Credit RatingsWe rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and industry-wide factors.\n"

In addition, the issuance of borrowings with original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit-sensitive instruments. Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types.The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit. We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases of our borrowings as part of our market-making activities.For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the financial statements.Credit RatingsWe rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of our daily operations. Our credit ratings are one of the factors in the cost and availability of financing and can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as certain OTC derivative transactions.

Under the Standardized Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures, particularly in foreign exchange, growth in lending within the Institutional Securities business segment, Securities financing transactions, Other credit risk driven by higher warehouse loan securitizations, cash and deferred tax assets, and growth in Equity investments. Under the Advanced Approach, the increase was primarily due to higher Derivatives exposures, particularly in foreign exchange, growth in lending within the Institutional Securities business segment, Other credit risk driven by higher warehouse loan securitizations, cash and deferred tax assets, and growth in Equity investments.Market risk RWA increased in the current year period under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches, primarily driven by higher Specific Risk due to Non-Securitization standardized charges, Regulatory VaR and Regulatory Stressed VaR, partially offset by lower incremental risk charges driven by decreased exposures to non-investment grade issuances.The decrease in Operational risk RWA in the current year period is primarily related to lower execution-related losses, partially offset by an increase in litigation-related incidents.Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution strategy is used.Required and Actual TLAC and Eligible LTD Ratios Actual Amount/Ratio$ in millionsRegulatory MinimumRequired Ratio1AtSeptember 30,2025 AtDecember 31,2024 External TLAC2$275,931 $266,146 External TLAC as a % of RWA18.0%21.5%51.2%55.8%External TLAC as a % of leverage exposure7.5%9.5%16.6%17.5%Eligible LTD3$172,554 $169,690 Eligible LTD as a % of RWA9.0%9.0%32.0%35.5%Eligible LTD as a % of leverage exposure4.5%4.5%10.4%11.2%1.Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers. 2.External TLAC consists of CET1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital (each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD. 3.Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance sheet date.We are in compliance with all TLAC requirements as of September 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For a further discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements” in the 2024 Form 10-K.Capital Plans, Stress Tests and the Stress Capital BufferThe Federal Reserve has capital planning and stress test requirements for large BHCs, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s annual CCAR framework.We must submit, on at least an annual basis, a capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate annual stress tests designed by us and the Federal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy. As insured depository institutions (“IDIs”) with less than $250 billion of average total assets over the four most recent consecutive quarters, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are not subject to company-run stress test regulatory requirements.\n"

Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB resulted in an aggregate Standardized Approach CET1 required ratio of 13.5%.For the 2025 capital planning and stress test cycle, we submitted our capital plan and company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April 7, 2025. On September 30, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced that it had reduced Morgan Stanley’s SCB from 5.1% to 4.3%, effective on October 1, 2025 in response to the Firm seeking reconsideration of its preliminary SCB announced in June 2025. Together with other features of the regulatory capital framework, this SCB results in an aggregate Standardized Approach CET1 ratio of 11.8%. Generally, our SCB is determined annually based on the results of the supervisory stress test. On April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks. See “Regulatory Developments and Other Matters—Proposed Changes to Capital Requirements” herein. If relevant, the Firm will provide updated information on applicable regulatory capital standards in response to a final rulemaking, including any change in the Firm’s SCB.We also disclosed a summary of the results of our company-run stress tests on our Investor Relations website and increased our quarterly common stock dividend to $1.00 per share from $0.925, beginning with the common stock dividend announced on July 16, 2025.

Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage-based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset unless a significant business change occurs (e.g., acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company common equity.

Under the proposal, our SCB would be based, in part, on the average of the post-stress capital decline embedded in the Federal Reserve’s stress test results over two consecutive years. Additionally, the proposal would shift the annual effective date of the revised SCB from October 1 to January 1 of the following year and modify certain elements of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program. Proposed Changes to the Enhanced Supplementary Leverage RatioOn June 25, 2025, the U.S. banking agencies released a proposal to modify eSLR requirements applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their U.S. IDI subsidiaries. If adopted, the proposal would modify the eSLR buffer applicable to U.S. G-SIBs to equal 50 percent of each BHC’s Method 1 G-SIB capital surcharge, applied above the 3.0% minimum SLR requirement, and would modify eSLR standards for U.S. G-SIBs’ IDI subsidiaries to have the same form and calibration as the BHC-level standard. As a result, under the proposal, the Firm and its U.S. Bank Subsidiaries would each have been subject to a 3.5% SLR requirement (inclusive of a 0.5% eSLR buffer) as of June 30, 2025, as compared with current standards, which impose a 5.0% SLR requirement on the Firm (inclusive of a 2.0% eSLR buffer) and require the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet a 6.0% SLR requirement above the minimum 3.0% SLR requirement to be deemed “well capitalized.” The Federal Reserve has also proposed conforming modifications to the SLR component of TLAC and LTD requirements, which currently incorporate the U.S. G-SIB 2.0% eSLR buffer. For more information on the leverage-based regulatory capital standards, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements” in the 2024 Form 10-K. Supervisory Stress Testing ProposalsOn October 24, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to its supervisory stress testing framework through two related proposals. The first proposal would modify the timeline and operation of the annual supervisory stress test, including through revisions to the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress testing policy statements, and solicits comment on the Federal Reserve’s supervisory stress testing models. The second proposal solicits comment on the Federal Reserve’s proposed scenarios for the 2026 supervisory stress test. We continue to monitor developments related to these proposals.\nTITLE: Regulatory Developments and Other Matters\nTITLE: Proposed Changes to Capital Requirements\nTEXT: On April 17, 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the SCB and CCAR frameworks applicable to us, aimed at reducing the volatility of the capital requirements stemming from the Federal Reserve’s annual stress test results.
