We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit our credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments exceeds or falls below contractually established thresholds. The cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements was $624 million and $714 million as of October 27, 2024 and January 28, 2024, respectively, which was recorded in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

A liability’s fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, rather than the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value.

On June 18, 2024, following the satisfaction or waiver of the applicable closing conditions, including receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals, the acquisition was completed and all merger consideration was transferred. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of The Home Depot, Inc. merged with and into Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc., the parent company of SRS, with Shingle Acquisition Holdings, Inc. as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We believe the acquisition of SRS will accelerate the Company’s growth with the residential professional customer. The acquisition is expected to complement our existing capabilities and enable us to better serve complex project purchase occasions with the renovator/remodeler, while also establishing the Company as a leading specialty trade distributor across multiple verticals. We primarily used a combination of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, the issuance of long-term debt, as well as cash on hand to fund the acquisition. See Note 5 for further information on the financing for the transaction, and below for a summary of preliminary purchase consideration.\nTEXT: The acquisition was accounted for in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805 “Business Combinations,” and SRS’s results of operations have been consolidated in the Company’s financial statements effective June 18, 2024.

A portion of such shares of Company common stock are fully vested, and accordingly, the fair value of such shares was recorded as non-cash purchase consideration. A portion of such shares of Company common stock, which replaced legacy SRS stock-based awards, are subject to service-based vesting conditions over a three-year period and become forfeitable if such vesting conditions are not satisfied. Accordingly, a portion of the fair value of these shares was recorded as non-cash purchase consideration, and the remainder will be recorded as post-combination expense over the vesting period.

Net earnings were $3.6 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share.

For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, sales per retail square foot were $582.97, and for the first nine months of fiscal 2024, sales per retail square foot were $604.11. Our inventory turnover ratio was 4.8 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 4.3 times at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by lower average inventory levels within our Primary segment during the first nine months of fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we generated $15.1 billion of cash flow from operations, received approximately $10.0 billion of proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.3 billion of proceeds from commercial paper borrowings, net of repayments. We utilized a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the issuance of long-term debt, together with cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of SRS, with cash purchase consideration totaling $17.7 billion. Specifically, in June 2024, leading up to the acquisition on June 18, 2024, we raised commercial paper borrowings of over $15.0 billion to fund the transaction, of which approximately $10.0 billion was then immediately repaid with the proceeds from our issuance of long-term debt. We have continued to repay a portion of these outstanding commercial paper borrowings and ended the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with $1.3 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding.\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we also paid $6.7 billion in cash dividends, funded $2.4 billion in capital expenditures, repaid $1.4 billion of long-term debt, and funded $649 million of share repurchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024.\nTEXT: In February 2024, we announced a 7.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $2.25 per share.\nTEXT: Our ROIC for the trailing twelve-month period was 31.5% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and 38.7% at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in ROIC was primarily driven by higher average long-term debt and higher average equity due to the financing of the SRS acquisition, along with lower operating income.

Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $40.2 billion, an increase of 6.6% from $37.7 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by SRS, which contributed $2.9 billion of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase in net sales was partially offset by the impact of a negative comparable sales environment, primarily driven by decreases in comparable average ticket and comparable customer transactions.\nTEXT: Online sales, which consist of sales generated through our websites and mobile applications for products picked up at our stores or delivered to customer locations, represented 14.0% of net sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and increased by 4.0% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nTEXT: A stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted net sales by $131 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTEXT: Comparable Sales. Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our existing locations and websites by measuring the change in net sales for a period over the comparable prior period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes sales at all locations, physical and online, open greater than 52 weeks (including remodels and relocations) and excludes closed stores. Retail stores become comparable on the Monday following their 52nd week of operation. Acquisitions are typically included in comparable sales after they have been owned for more than 52 weeks. Comparable sales is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTEXT: Total comparable sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 1.3%, reflecting a 0.8% decrease in comparable average ticket and a 0.6% decrease in comparable customer transactions compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in comparable customer transactions primarily reflects the impact of heightened macroeconomic uncertainties and other macroeconomic factors, including the impacts of a persisting high interest rate environment pressuring home improvement demand. The decrease in comparable average ticket primarily reflects price stabilization relative to last year, slightly offset by demand for new and innovative products. Comparable sales during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 also reflects incremental sales related to hurricane demand.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our Power, Outdoor Garden, Building Materials, Indoor Garden, and Paint merchandising departments posted positive comparable sales compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

Gross profit as a percentage of net sales, or gross profit margin, was 33.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 33.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross profit margin primarily reflects the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results, partially offset by lower shrink within our Primary segment.\nTITLE: Operating Expenses\nTEXT: Our operating expenses are composed of SG&A and depreciation and amortization.\nTEXT: Selling, General & Administrative. SG&A for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $563 million, or 8.5%, to $7.2 billion from $6.6 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A was 17.9% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 17.6% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting higher payroll and other operational costs, along with deleverage from a negative comparable sales environment, all within our Primary segment, partially offset by the inclusion of SRS in our consolidated results.\nTEXT: Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $112 million, or 16.4%, to $795 million from $683 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, depreciation and amortization was 2.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.8% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting increased intangible asset amortization expense of $90 million, of which $86 million was related to SRS.\nTITLE: Interest and Other, net\nTEXT: Interest and other, net for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased $157 million, or 35.8%, to $595 million from $438 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of net sales, interest and other, net was 1.5% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 1.2% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting higher interest expense driven by higher long-term debt.\nTITLE: Provision for Income Taxes\nTEXT: Our combined effective income tax rate was 24.4% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23.3% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in our effective rate reflects certain one-time tax benefits recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nTITLE: Diluted Earnings per Share\nTEXT: Diluted earnings per share were $3.67 for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $3.81 for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

We believe that our current cash position, cash flow generated from operations, funds available from our commercial paper program, and access to the long-term debt capital markets should be sufficient not only for our operating requirements, any required debt payments, and satisfaction of other contractual obligations, but also to enable us to invest in the business, fund dividend payments, and fund any share repurchases through the next several fiscal years. In addition, we believe that we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary.\nTEXT: Our material cash requirements include contractual and other obligations arising in the normal course of business. These obligations primarily include long-term debt and related interest payments, operating and finance lease obligations, and purchase obligations. In addition to our cash requirements, we follow a disciplined approach to capital allocation. This approach first prioritizes investing in the business, followed by paying dividends, with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. In March 2024, we paused share repurchases in anticipation of the acquisition of SRS. We do not currently plan to resume share repurchases until we have used our excess cash to reduce our outstanding debt.\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we invested approximately $2.4 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures. For fiscal 2024, in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sales on an annual basis, we plan to invest approximately $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditures, with investments focused on new stores and improving the customer experience, including through technology and development of other differentiated capabilities. However, we may adjust our capital expenditures to support the operations of the business, to enhance long-term strategic positioning, or in response to the economic environment, as necessary or appropriate.\nTEXT: In February 2024, we announced a 7.7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $2.09 to $2.25 per share. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we paid cash dividends of $6.7 billion to shareholders. We intend to pay a dividend in the future; however, any future dividend is subject to declaration by our Board of Directors based on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors.\nTEXT: In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved in August 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As of October 27, 2024, approximately $11.7 billion of the $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we had cash payments of $649 million for repurchases of our common stock through open market purchases, prior to pausing share repurchases in March 2024 as discussed above.\n"

On June 25, 2024, we received the proceeds from the issuance of $10.0 billion of long-term debt, and immediately used the proceeds to repay approximately $10.0 billion of these commercial paper borrowings. On June 27, 2024, we terminated the $10.0 billion back-up credit facility, and subsequently reduced our commercial paper program from $19.5 billion to $9.5 billion.\nTEXT: In July 2024, we completed the renewal of our 364-day $1.5 billion credit facility, extending the maturity from July 2024 to July 2025. As of October 27, 2024, our commercial paper program allowed for borrowings up to $9.5 billion and is supported by $9.5 billion of back-up credit facilities.\nTEXT: All of our short-term borrowings in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 were under our commercial paper program, and the maximum amount outstanding at any time was $15.3 billion. At October 27, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program of $1.3 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%, we had no outstanding borrowings under our back-up credit facilities, and we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in our credit facilities, none of which are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources.\nTEXT: We also issue senior notes from time to time as part of our capital management strategy. As discussed above, in June 2024, we issued $10.0 billion of senior notes in connection with the funding of the acquisition of SRS. Separately, in February 2024, we repaid $1.1 billion of senior notes at maturity.\nTEXT: The indentures governing our senior notes do not generally limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. The indentures governing our notes contain various customary covenants; however, none of the covenants are expected to impact our liquidity or capital resources. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt arrangements.\nTITLE: CASH FLOWS SUMMARY\nTITLE: Operating Activities\nTEXT: Cash flow generated from operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity. Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, associate compensation, operations, occupancy costs, and income taxes. Cash provided by or used in operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nTEXT: Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.3 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were primarily driven by more normalized inventory levels during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to strategic reductions in inventory during fiscal 2023, as well as timing of vendor payments, each within our Primary segment.\nTITLE: Investing Activities\nTEXT: Net cash used in investing activities increased by $16.8 billion in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher cash payments for business acquisitions in fiscal 2024, including $17.6 billion of cash consideration paid to acquire SRS, net of cash acquired.\n"

Net cash used in financing activities in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily reflected $6.5 billion of share repurchases, $6.3 billion of cash dividends paid, and $1.2 billion of long-term debt repayments.\nTEXT: The overall increase in cash flows from financing activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 totaled $16.6 billion and was predominantly attributable to the financing of the SRS acquisition. Specifically, as discussed above, a combination of commercial paper borrowings and the $10.0 billion long-term debt issuance, along with increased cash on hand resulting from the pause of share repurchases, were utilized in connection with the SRS acquisition.\nTITLE: CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nTEXT: During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, there were no changes to our critical accounting estimates or our significant accounting policies as disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K, except as set forth below. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTITLE: Business Combinations\nTEXT: We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when fair value is not readily available and requires a significant amount of management judgment. For the valuation of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, we typically use an income approach. Specifically, for the SRS acquisition, we used the multi-period excess earnings method to value the customer relationships intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of customer relationships included forecasted revenues, expected customer attrition rates, and discount rates. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair values of the customer relationships intangible assets acquired.\nTEXT: The excess of the purchase price over fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill due to the use of preliminary information in our initial estimates. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nTITLE: ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nTEXT: For information on accounting pronouncements that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.\nTITLE: ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nTEXT: The following table presents the number and average price of shares purchased in each fiscal month of the third quarter of fiscal 2024:\nTEXT: PeriodTotal Number of Shares Purchased(1)Average Price Paid Per Share(1)(3)Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program(2)Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program(2)(3)July 29, 2024 – August 25, 202413,486 $361.72 — $11,657,503,041 August 26, 2024 – September 22, 20241,668 368.92 — 11,657,503,041 September 23, 2024 – October 27, 202410,251 394.46 — 11,657,503,041 25,405 375.40 —\nTABLE: TABLE: Period Total Number of Shares Purchased(1) Average Price Paid Per Share(1)(3) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program(2) Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Program(2)(3); July 29, 2024 – August 25, 2024 13,486 $ 361.72 — $ 11,657,503,041; August 26, 2024 – September 22, 2024 1,668 368.92 — 11,657,503,041; September 23, 2024 – October 27, 2024 10,251 394.46 — 11,657,503,041; 25,405 375.40 —.\nTITLE: Period\nTITLE: Total Number of Shares Purchased(1)\nTITLE: Average Price Paid Per Share(1)(3)\nTITLE: Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Program(2)\n"

Under the Plans, participants surrender shares as payment of applicable tax withholding on the vesting of restricted stock. Participants in the Plans may also exercise stock options by surrendering shares of common stock that the participants already own as payment of the exercise price. Shares so surrendered by participants in the Plans are repurchased pursuant to the terms of the Plans and applicable award agreement and not pursuant to publicly announced share repurchase programs.\nTEXT: (2)On August 14, 2023, our Board of Directors approved a $15.0 billion share repurchase authorization that replaced the previous authorization of $15.0 billion, which was approved on August 18, 2022. The August 2023 authorization does not have a prescribed expiration date. As previously disclosed, we paused share repurchases in March 2024.\nTEXT: (3)Excludes excise taxes incurred on share repurchases.\nTITLE: SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we issued 480 deferred stock units under The Home Depot, Inc. Nonemployee Directors’ Deferred Stock Compensation Plan pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of the SEC’s Regulation D thereunder. The deferred stock units were credited during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 to the accounts of those non-employee directors who elected to receive all or a portion of board retainers in the form of deferred stock units instead of cash. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in this plan.\nTEXT: During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we credited 876 deferred stock units to participant accounts under the Restoration Plans pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act for involuntary, non-contributory plans. The deferred stock units convert to shares of common stock on a one-for-one basis following a termination of service as described in these plans.\n"

We are also exposed to risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars and on the purchase of goods by these foreign operations that are not denominated in their local currencies. Additionally, we may experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase and sale of certain commodity products.
