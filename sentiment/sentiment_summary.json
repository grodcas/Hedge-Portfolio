      "summary": "On November 28, 2025, the total put/call ratio stood at 0.7, suggesting a generally risk-on sentiment. However, index-related ratios such as the index put/call ratio (1.06) and SPX/SPXW (1.01) were near or above 1.0, indicating cautiousness or increased hedging in broader market indices. Elevated ratios in some regional indices, notably MXEF (11.78) and MXEA (2.4), reflect heightened caution or fear in those markets. The high put/call ratio on the VIX (1.47) also signals increased demand for options protection amid volatility concerns. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a dominance of risk-on behavior tempered by pockets of increased caution."
